<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In justice to those principles which influenced the policy of the
Post Office before the introduction of penny postage, it is perhaps
unnecessary to call attention to the fact that no opinion as to their
desirability or otherwise is justifiable which does not take into
consideration the conditions and prejudices which then prevailed.
Some of the earlier writers on the Post Office have made the mistake
of condemning everything which has not satisfied the measure
of their own particular rule. If there is anything that the historical
treatment of a subject teaches the investigator it is an appreciation
of the fact that different conditions call for different methods of
treatment. For example, the introduction of cheap postage was
possibly delayed too long. But during the era of high postal rates a
large net revenue was of primary importance, nor were those conditions
present which would have made low rates a success.
</p>

<p>
The consideration of such debatable subjects as the telegraph
system of the Postal Department and the department's attitude
toward the telephone companies, as well as the intention of the Post
Office to acquire the business of the latter, must necessarily give
rise to controversy. Thanks to the magnificent net revenue obtained
from letters in the United Kingdom the department has
been able to lose a good deal of money by the extension of its activities
into the realm of affairs not purely postal. Possibly a <i>democratic</i>
type of government should, from the financial point of view,
interfere least in the direct management of economic institutions,
on account of the pressure which can easily be brought to bear upon
it for the extension of such institutions on other than economic
grounds. If non-economic principles are to be substituted in justifying
the initiation or increase of government ownership, a popular
form of government seems the least suitable for the presentation of
such as shall be fair to all concerned, not to mention the difficult
problem of dealing with those members of the civil service who do
not hesitate to make use of their political power to enforce their
demands upon the government.
</p>

<p>
In the treatment of a subject so complex as the history of the
British Post Office it is not easy to decide how far its presentation
should be strictly chronological or how far it should be mounted in
"longitudinal sections," exposing its most salient features. Both
methods have their advantages and their disadvantages. In order
to obtain what is useful in both, I have described chronologically in
the first four chapters the progress of the Post Office, while in the
remaining chapters I have examined separately some of the more
important aspects of postal development. But I am aware that by
this compromise I have not entirely escaped the dangers of abrupt
transitions from subject to subject and of the accumulation of dry
details. I can only plead in extenuation, in the first place the nature
of my subject, an institution with a long and varied history,
characterized by the steady extension of its field of activity,
and in the second place my desire to make my study as thorough as possible,
even at the risk of some sacrifice of unity and interest of treatment.
</p>

The material for this sketch has been obtained from the Harvard
University Library, the Boston Public Library, and the Canadian
Parliamentary Library. Work was also done in the Library of the
British Museum. I wish to acknowledge the help I have received
from the advice and criticism of Professor Gay, under whose supervision
the larger part of this history was prepared.

<p class="heading1">THE HISTORY OF<br />
THE BRITISH POST OFFICE</p>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center"><b>THE POSTAL ESTABLISHMENT SUPPORTED DIRECTLY<br />BY THE STATE</b></p>


<p>The history of the British Post Office starts with the beginning of the
sixteenth century. Long before this, however, a system of communication
had been established both for the personal use of the King and for the
conveyance of official letters and documents. These continued to be the
principal functions of the royal posts until well on in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>Before the sixteenth century, postal communications were carried on by
royal messengers. These messengers either received stated wages or were
paid according to the length of the journeys they made. We find them
mentioned as early as the reign of King John under the name of <i>nuncii</i>
or <i>cursores</i>; and payments to them form a large item in the Household
and Wardrobe accounts of the King as early as these accounts exist.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
They travelled the whole of the journey themselves and delivered their
letters personally to the people to whom they were directed. A somewhat
different style of postal service, a precursor of the modern method, was
inaugurated by the fourth Edward. During the war with Scotland he found
himself in need of a speedier and better system of communication between
the seat of war and the seat of government. He accomplished this by
placing horses at intervals of twenty miles along the great road between
England and Scotland. By so doing his messengers were able to take up
fresh horses along the way and his despatches were carried at the rate
of a hundred miles a day.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4">[4]</a></span></p><p>From an early period private letters were conveyed by carriers

the different members of the Paston family, throw some light upon
the manner in which letters were conveyed during the latter half
of the fifteenth century. Judging from such references as we find
in the letters themselves, they were generally carried by a servant,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
a messenger,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or a friend.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The later letters of this series, written

London and Norwich and other parts of Norfolk.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> From the

correspondence between England and the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> For the

merchants.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Sir Brian Tuke is the first English Postmaster-General of whom
we have any record. The King's "Book of Payments" for the year
1512 contains an order for the payment of £100 to Sir Brian for his
use as Master of the Posts.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> As the King's appointed Postmaster,
he received a salary of £66 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He named the postmen, or
deputy postmasters as they were called later, and he was held responsible
for the performance of their duties.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> All letters carried
by the royal postmen were delivered to him, and after being sorted
by him personally were carried to their destination by the court
messengers.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The wages of the postmen varied from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> a day
according to the number of horses provided, and they were paid by
the Postmaster-General, who had authority to make all payments
to those regularly employed.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> If messages or letters were sent by
special messengers, their payment entailed additional expense
upon the state and the use of such messengers, when regular postmen
were available, was strongly discouraged.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>In addition to his other duties Sir Brian was supposed to have
a general supervision over the horses used for the conveyance of
letters and of travellers riding on affairs of state. Of course on the
regular roads there were always horses in readiness, provided by
the postmen. Where there were no regular post roads, the townships
were supposed to provide the necessary horses, and it was part
of the Postmaster-General's duties to see that the townships were
kept up to the mark.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It was largely on account of the fact that the
same horses were used for conveying travellers and mails that the
systems of postal and personal communication were so closely
interwoven as well in England as in continental countries.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The postmen along the old established routes and on the routes
temporarily established for some definite purpose received a fixed
daily wage. These men were called the ordinary posts.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> If, however,
letters should arrive in Dover after the ordinary post had left for
London, they were generally sent on at once by a messenger hired
for the occasion only. He was called a special post and was paid
only for the work which he actually performed.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Those regular posts,
who carried the royal and state letters between London and the
place where the Court might be, were called "Court Posts."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> During
the sovereign's tours, posts were always stationed between
him and London to carry his and the state's letters backward and
forward. These were called extraordinary posts and received regular
wages while so employed.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In addition there were always messengers
employed to carry important despatches to foreign sovereigns.
These received no fixed wages, but were paid according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6">[6]</a></span>
to the distance travelled and the expenses incurred on the
road.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Apart from his regular duties as outlined above, the Postmaster-General
had little initiative power. He could not on his own responsibility
order new posts to be laid. Such decisions always originated
with the King or the Council and Tuke simply executed their
orders.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Any increase in the wages of the posts also required the
consent of the King or Council.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>During the sixteenth century there were three ways to send
letters between England and the Continent: by the Royal Post, the
Foreigners' Post, and the Merchant Adventurers' Post, apart from
such opportunities as occasional travellers and messengers offered.
The Royal Posts were presumed to carry only state letters, and consequently
the conveyance of a large part of the private letters fell
to the other two. Owing to industrial and later to religious motives
there had been a large emigration of foreigners from the Continent
to England. Edward III had induced many Flemings to leave their
native country in the middle of the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Froude
says, probably with exaggeration, that in 1527 there were 15,000
Flemings in London alone.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In the fifteenth century many Italian
artisans came over to reside but not to settle.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> They were a thrifty
people, who did much to place the industrial life of England on a
better footing, and were probably more intelligent and better educated
than the majority of the English artisans among whom they
settled. It seems therefore only natural that they should seek to
establish a better system of communication between their adopted
and native countries. Their business relations with the cloth markets
of the continental cities made necessary a better and speedier
postal system than was afforded by the Royal Posts. In addition
to this, it was only by act of grace that private letters were carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7">[7]</a></span>by Tuke's postmen. In the opening year of the sixteenth century,
by permission of the state, the foreign merchants in London established
a system of posts of their own between the English capital
and the Continent. This was called the "Foreign or Strangers'
Post," and was managed by a Postmaster-General, nominated by
the Italians, Spanish, and Dutch and confirmed by the Council.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
These posts were used largely by the English merchants in spite
of considerable dissatisfaction on account of the poor service afforded
and on political grounds. Their grievances were detailed in
a petition to the Privy Council. They considered it unprecedented
that so important a service as the carriage of letters should be in
the hands of men who owed no allegiance to the King. Such a procedure
was unheard of in any of the continental countries. "What
check could there be over treasonable correspondence while the
carriage of letters continued to be in the hands of foreigners and
most of them Dutchmen?" In addition they were not treated so well
as were their fellow merchants of foreign allegiance. Their letters
were often retained for several days at a time, while all others were
delivered as soon as they arrived. The foreign ambassadors could
not complain if a change were made, for most of their correspondence
was carried on by special messengers.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The "Strangers'
Post" seems to have come to an end after the Proclamation of 1591
was issued, forbidding any but the Royal Posts from carrying letters
to and from foreign countries.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Sir Brian Tuke died in 1545 and was succeeded by Sir John
Mason and Mr. Paget, who acted as joint Postmasters-General.
Mr. Paget was the sleeping partner, and what little was done was
by Mason.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> They were succeeded in 1568 by Thomas Randolph.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
He was occasionally sent as special ambassador to France and during
his absence Gascoyne, a former court post, performed his duties.
From Sir Brian's death until the end of Elizabeth's reign was a
period of little advance in postal matters. The regular posts, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8">[8]</a></span>is with them that our chief interest lies, appear to have fallen into
disuse. The payments for special messengers are much larger than
they had been during Henry's reign. In 1549, a warrant was issued
empowering Sir John Mason to pay £400 to the special messengers
used during the summer. If anything was left, he was instructed to
use it in paying arrears due the ordinary posts.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Elizabeth is generally
credited with being economical to the extreme of parsimony
so far as state expenses were concerned. However this may be, she
is responsible for an order to discharge all the regular posts unless
they would serve for half of their old wages.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The postmen did not
receive their wages at all regularly. Randolph was accused by the
Governor of Berwick of withholding all of their first year's wages,
of receiving every year thereafter a percentage of their salaries,
and of demanding certain fees from them, all for his personal use.
The Governor considered that Randolph's extortions were largely
the cause of the general inefficiency in the posts,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> but the accusation
may have been due to personal grudge. At any rate one measure of
postal reform may be credited to Randolph. In 1582, orders were
issued to all the London-Berwick posts to the following effect.
Every post on the arrival of letters to or from the Queen or Council
was to fasten a label to the packet. On this label he was to write
the day and hour when the packet came into his hands and he was
to make the same entry in a book kept for the purpose. He was
also to keep two or three good horses in his stable for the speedier
conveyance of such packets.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In 1590, John Lord Stanhope was appointed Postmaster-General
by order of the Queen. The office was given to him for his life and
then was to go to his son for his son's life.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Both the Stanhopes were
men of action, but they looked upon their position rather as a
means of enriching themselves than as a trust for the good of the
state. They proved a stumbling block to the advancement of better
men and it was not for sixty years that they were finally swept
away to make room for men of greater ability. In 1621, the elder
Stanhope was succeeded by his son Charles according to the terms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9">[9]</a></span>of the original patent.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It had been the custom for the Postmasters-General
to demand fees and percentages from their appointees. So
lucrative were many of their positions from the monopoly in letting
horses and the receipts from private letters that many applicants
were willing to pay for appointments as deputy postmasters. The
ordinary payments when Lord Charles was at the head of the posts
amounted to 2s. in the pound as poundage and a fee of £2 from
each man. These payments were considered so exorbitant that the
Council ordered them to be reduced.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> One, Hutchins, entered the
lists as the champion of the postmasters. He himself was one of
them and acted as their solicitor in the contest. Stanhope was glad
to compound the case by the payment of £30. Hutchins gave the
Council so much trouble that they gave orders that "turbulent
Hutchins" should cease to act as the postmasters' solicitor and
leave them in peace.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> His object, however, seems to have been
accomplished so far as Stanhope was concerned. The struggle
with the Paymasters of the Posts was not so successful, for, supported
by a report of the Treasurer, they continued to receive their
shilling in the pound.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>By a Privy Council Proclamation issued in 1603, all posts receiving
a daily fee were required to have two leather bags, lined
with "bayes" or cotton, and the post himself was to sound a horn
whenever he met any one on the road or four times in every mile.
The packet of letters was not to be delayed more than fifteen minutes
and was to be carried at a rate of seven miles an hour in summer
and five in winter. The time at which it was delivered into a
post's hands and the names and addresses of the people by whom
and to whom it was sent were to be entered in a book kept for the
purpose. All posts and their servants were exempted from being
"pressed" and from attendance at assizes, sessions, inquests, and
musters.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>It is doubtful how far the postmasters were held responsible for
the delivery of letters to the persons to whom they were addressed.
This did not become a burning question, however, until after the
recognition of the fact that the letters of private individuals should
receive as good treatment at the hands of the postmen as the letters
of the state officials. Lord Stanhope in 1618 issued an order to the
Justices of the Peace in Southwark to aid the postmaster of that
place in the delivery of letters within six miles.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This was followed
two years later by a general order to establish two or three foot-posts
in every parish for the conveyance of letters.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>During the early part of the seventeenth century, Stanhope had
employed a foreigner, de Quester, as one of the King's posts "beyond
seas." He commended himself to the notice of his superiors by
his promptitude in dealing with the foreign letters.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In 1619 James
appointed him Postmaster-General for "foreign parts" and henceforth
he was his own master.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> This was followed four years later
by a formal proclamation, confirming to de Quester and his son the
position already granted to the father.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He was to have the sole
monopoly of carrying foreign letters and was to appoint the necessary
officials. All persons were formally prohibited from entrenching
upon the privileges granted him in 1619. From this time until
1635, the foreign and inland posts were under separate management
and the accounts were kept separate until long after the latter date.
Stanhope was unwilling to submit to the curtailment of his profits,
which necessarily followed the appointment of de Quester. There
was much to be said for Stanhope's contention that the patent of
1623 was illegal for, ever since there had been a Postmaster-General,
his duties had extended to the foreign as well as to the inland
office. The question was referred to a committee, composed of the
Lord Chamberlain, one of the Secretaries of State and the Attorney-General,
who decided that Stanhope's patent extended only to
the inland office.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The whole question was finally brought before
the Court of King's Bench, which decided the case in favour of
Stanhope.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This was in 1625, but de Quester seems to have paid no
attention to the decision for it is certain that he continued to act as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11">[11]</a></span>Foreign Postmaster until 1629<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and in 1632 he resigned his patent
to Frizell and Witherings. It can be imagined what must have been
the chaotic condition of the foreign post while this struggle was going
on. The Merchant Adventurers established posts of their own
between London and the Continent under Billingsley. The Council
issued the most perplexing orders. First they forbade Billingsley
from having anything to do with foreign letters.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Then they decided
that the Adventurers might establish posts of their own and
choose a Postmaster.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Then they extended the same privilege to
all merchants. Next this was withdrawn and the Adventurers were
allowed to send letters only to Antwerp, Delft and Hamburg or
wherever the staple of cloth might be.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> These orders do not seem
to have been passed in full council for, in 1628, Secretary Coke in
writing to Secretary Conway said that "Billingsley, a broker by
trade, strives to draw over to the merchants that power over
foreign letters which in all states is a branch of royal authority.
The merchant's purse has swayed much in other matters but he
has never heard that it encroached upon the King's prerogative
until now." He adds "I confess it troubleth me to see the audacity
of men in these times and especially that Billingsley." He enclosed
a copy of an order "made at a full Council and under the
Broad Seal," which in effect was a supersedeas of the place which
de Quester enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> When de Quester resigned in favour of Frizell
and Witherings, the resignation and new appointments were confirmed
by the King.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Of these men Witherings was far the abler.
He had a plan in view, which was eventually to place the foreign
and inland systems on a basis unchanged until the time of penny
postage. In the meantime he had to overcome the prejudices of
the King and get rid of Frizell. In order to raise money for the
promotion of his plan, Witherings mortgaged his place. Capital
was obtained from the Earl of Arundel and others through John
Hall, who held the mortgage. The King heard of this and ordered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12">[12]</a></span>the office to be sequestered to his old servant de Quester and commanded
Hall to make over his interest to the same person.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> There
were now three claimants for the place, Frizell, Witherings, and
de Quester. Frizell rushed off to Court, where he offered to pay off
his part of the mortgage and asked to have sole charge of the Foreign
Post. "Witherings," he said, "proposes to take charge of all
packets of State if he may have the office, but being a home-bred
shopkeeper, without languages, tainted of delinquency and in dislike
with the foreign correspondents, he is no fit person to carry a
trust of such secrecy and importance."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Coke knew better than
this, however, and through his influence Witherings, who had in
the meantime paid off the mortgage and satisfied Frizell's interest,
was made sole Postmaster-General for Foreign Parts.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
With Witherings' advent a new period of English postal history
begins. His dominant idea was to make the posts self-supporting
and no longer a charge to the state. It had been established as a
service for the royal household and continued as an official necessity.
The letters of private individuals had been carried by its
messengers but the state had derived no revenue for their conveyance.
The convenient activity of other agencies for the carriage
of private letters was not only tolerated but officially recognized.
The change to a revenue-paying basis tended naturally to emphasize
the monopolistic character of the government service.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13">[13]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center"><b>THE POSTAL ESTABLISHMENT A SOURCE OF REVENUE<br /> TO THE STATE</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>1633-1711</b></p>


<p>For some time there had been dissatisfaction with the services
rendered by the inland posts. It was said that letters would arrive
sooner from Spain and Italy than from remote parts of the kingdom
of England.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The only alternative was to send them by express
and this was not only expensive but was not looked upon with
favour by the Postmaster-General. The five great roads from London
to Edinburgh, Holyhead, Bristol, Plymouth, and Dover were
in operation. From the Edinburgh Road there were branches to
York and Carlisle, from the Dover Road to Margate, Gravesend,
and Sandwich, and from the Plymouth Road to Falmouth, but the
posts were slow and the rates for private letters uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In
1633, a project was advanced for the new arrangement of the Post
Office. The plan was not entirely theoretical, for an attempt was
made to show that it would prove a financial success. There were
about 512 market towns in England. It was considered that each
of these would send 50 letters a week to London and as many answers
would be returned. At 4<i>d.</i> a day for each letter, this would
amount to £426 a week. The charge for conveyance was estimated
at £37 a week, leaving a weekly profit of £389, from which £1500 a
year for the conveyance of state letters and despatches must be
deducted. Letters on the northern road were to pay 2<i>d.</i> for a single
and 4<i>d.</i> for a double letter, to Yorkshire and Northumberland 3<i>d.</i>,
and to Scotland 8<i>d.</i> a letter. The postmasters in the country were
not to take any charge for a letter except one penny for carriage
to the next market town.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It is probable that this project originated
with Witherings. At any rate it resembles closely the plan which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14">[14]</a></span>was introduced by him two years later. He had already reformed
the foreign post by appointing "stafetti" from London to Dover
and through France and they had proved so efficient as to disarm
the opposition even of the London merchants. His name is without
doubt the most distinguished in the annals of the British Post
Office. Convinced that the carriage of private letters must be
placed upon a secure footing, he laid the foundation for the system
of postal rates and regulations, which continued to the time of
national penny postage. He introduced the first legal provision
for the carriage of private letters at fixed rates, greatly increased
the speed of the posts, and above all made the Post Office a financial
success. In order to do this he saw that the proceeds from
private letters must go to the state and not to the deputy postmasters.</p>

<p>His plan was entitled "A proposition for settling of Stafetti or
pacquet posts betwixt London and all parts of His Majesty's Dominions.
The profits to go to pay the postmasters, who now are
paid by His Majesty at a cost of £3400 per annum." A general
office or counting house was to be established in London for the
reception of all letters coming to or leaving the capital. Letters
leaving London on each of the great roads were to be enclosed in a
leather "portmantle" and left at the post-towns on the way. Letters
for any of the towns off the great roads were to be placed in
smaller leather bags to be carried in the large portmantle. These
leather bags were to be left at the post-towns nearest the country
towns to which they were directed. They were then to be carried
to their destination by foot-posts to a distance of six or eight miles
and for each letter these foot-posts were to charge 2d., the same
price that was charged by the country carriers. At the same time
that the foot-posts delivered their letters, they were to collect letters
to be sent to London and carry them back to the post-town
from which they had started and there meet the portmantle on
its way back from Edinburgh or Bristol or wherever the terminus
of the road might be. The speed of the posts was to be at least 120
miles in twenty-four hours and they were to travel day and night.
He concludes his proposition by saying that no harm would result
to Stanhope by his plan "for neither Lord Stanhope nor anie<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15">[15]</a></span>
other, that ever enjoyed the Postmaster's place of England, had
any benefit of the carrying and re-carrying of the subjects' letters."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The question now was, Who was to see that these reforms were
carried out? Stanhope was not the man for so important and revolutionary
an undertaking. Witherings alone, the author of the
proposition, should carry it into effect. Sir John Coke made no
mistake in constituting himself the friend of the postal reformer.
Witherings was already Foreign Postmaster-General and in 1635
he was charged with the reformation of the inland office on the basis
of his projected scheme. In 1637 the inland and foreign offices were
again united when he was made Foreign and Inland Postmaster-General.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
His experiment was tried on the Northern Road first
and was exceedingly successful. Letters were sent to Edinburgh
and answers returned in six days. On the Northern Road
bye-posts were established to Lincoln, Hull and other places.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Orders were given to extend the same arrangement to the other
great roads, and by 1636 his reform was in full and profitable
operation.</p>

<p>Witherings still continued to sell the positions of the postmasters,
if we are to trust the complaints of non-successful applicants. One
man said that he offered £100 for a position but Witherings sold
it to another for £40.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The Postmaster at Ferrybridge asserted
that he had paid Stanhope £200 and Witherings £35 and yet
now fears that he will be ousted. Complaints of a reduction in
wages were also made, and this was a serious matter, since the postmasters
no longer obtained anything from private letters.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The
old complaint, however, of failure to pay wages at all is not heard
under Witherings' administration. He was punctual in his payments
and held his employees to equally rigid account. Their
arrears were not excused.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> An absentee postmaster, who hired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16">[16]</a></span>deputies to perform his duties, was dismissed.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> His ambition to
establish a self-supporting postal system demanded rigid economy
and strict administration, and with the then prevailing laxity of
administrative methods, this was no mean achievement. From
one occasional practice of the Post Office, that of tampering with
private letters, he cannot perhaps wholly be absolved. It is hinted
that he may have been guilty of opening letters, but the suggestion
follows that this may have happened before they reached England,
for the letters so opened were from abroad.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In June of 1637, Coke and Windebank, the two Secretaries of
State, were appointed Postmasters-General for their lives. The
surviving one was to surrender his office to the King, who would
then grant it to the Secretaries for the time being.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It does not
appear that Witherings was altogether dismissed from the service,
for his name continued to appear in connection with postal
affairs.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Windebank later urged as reasons for the withdrawal of
Witherings' patent, that he was not a sworn officer, that there was a
suspicion that his patent had been obtained surreptitiously, and that
the continental postmasters disdained to correspond with a man
of his low birth. He concludes by saying that something may be
given him, but that he is said to be worth £800 a year in land and to
have enriched himself from his position.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> At the time of his removal,
in June, 1637, the London merchants petitioned for his continuance
in office, as he had always given them satisfaction. When
they heard who had been appointed in his stead, like loyal and fearful
subjects, they hastened to add that they thought someone else
was trying for the position but they had no doubt that it would be
managed best by the Secretaries.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> If they thought so they were
mistaken, for the commander of the English army against Scotland
found that his letters were opened,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the Lord High Admiral complained
that his were delayed,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and Windebank promised an unknown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17">[17]</a></span>correspondent that the delay in his letters should be seen
to at once and Witherings was the agent chosen for the investigation.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
This, however, was not the worst, for only a month after
Witherings had been degraded, orders were issued to the postmasters
that no packets or letters were to be sent by post but such
as should be directed "For His Majesty's Special Affairs" and
were subscribed by certain officials connected with the Government.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
It is fair to add that this check on private correspondence
may have been a protective measure induced by the unsettled state
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>In 1640 both the inland and foreign offices were sequestered into
the hands of Philip Burlamachi, a wealthy London merchant who
had lent money to the king. No reasons were given except that
information had been received "of divers abuses and misdemeanours
committed by Thomas Witherings."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Stanhope, who had resigned
his patent in 1637, now came forward claiming that his resignation
had been unfairly obtained by the Council, and at the same
time he presented his bill for £1266, the arrears in his salary for
nineteen years.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> In reply to his demand it was said that shortly before
he resigned he had assigned his rights in the Post Office to the
Porters, father and son. The Attorney-General gave his opinion that
whatever rights Stanhope and the Porters had, they certainly had
no claim to the proceeds from the carriage of private letters.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Stanhope
had offered to enter an appearance in a suit brought against
him by the Porters but now he refused to do so.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Windebank was
also looking out for money due to him while Coke and he were
Postmasters-General.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The state had indeed entered upon troublous
times and it was every man for himself before it was too late.</p>

<p>As long as Witherings had enjoyed the King's favour, the House
of Commons had looked upon him with suspicion. They had ordered
in 1640 "that a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Grievances
should be made a House Committee to consider abuses in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18">[18]</a></span>inland posts, to take into consideration the rates for letters and
packets together with the abuses of Witherings and the rest of the
postmasters."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> As soon as Witherings was finally dismissed, the
Commons took him up and resolutions were passed that the sequestration
was illegal and ought to be repealed, that the proclamation
for ousting him from his position ought not to be put into execution,
and that he ought to be restored to his old position and be paid the
mean profits which had been received since his nominal dismissal.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Protected by the authority of the House of Commons, Witherings
continued to act as Postmaster-General.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Windebank, in Paris, was
trying to collect evidence against him through Frizell, who, he said,
had been forced out of his position by Witherings and Coke.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Coke
himself was in disgrace and could do nothing. Parliament was
now supreme. Witherings was ordered to send to a Committee of
the Lords, acting with Sir Henry Vane, all letters coming into or
going out of the kingdom for examination and search. Frequent
orders to the same effect followed during the turbulent summer
and autumn of 1641.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Among other letters opened were those of
the Venetian Ambassador in England. He was so indignant that a
Committee of the Lords was sent to him to ask his pardon.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The
two Houses of Parliament united in condemning the sequestration
to Burlamachi, but Witherings, who had become tired of the strife,
assigned his position to the Earl of Warwick.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The Earl was supported
by both Houses, but the Lower House played a double part,
for, while openly supporting Warwick, they now secretly favoured
Burlamachi, who had found an influential friend in Edmund Prideaux,
former chairman of the committee appointed to investigate
the condition of the posts and later Attorney-General under the
Commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Prideaux was a strong Parliamentarian, but was
distrusted even by his own friends. But for the time being, as the
representative of the Commons, he was supported by them. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19">[19]</a></span>messenger of the Upper House made oath that he had delivered the
Commons' resolution to Burlamachi, commanding him to hand
over the Inland Letter Office to Warwick, but James Hicks had
presented an order at the place appointed by Warwick for receiving
letters, to deliver all letters to Prideaux. Burlamachi on being summoned
before the Lords for contempt said that Prideaux had hired
his house and now had charge of the mails. The fight went merrily
on. Two servants of Warwick seized the Holyhead letters from
Hicks, but were in turn stopped by five troopers, agents of Prideaux,
who took the letters from them by order of the House of
Commons. Prideaux also seized the Chester and Plymouth letters,
one of his servants calling out "that an order of the House
of Commons ought to be obeyed before an order of the House of
Lords."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Hicks, who had been arrested by order of the Lords, was
liberated by the Commons as a servant of a member of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
As between Lords and Commons, there could be no doubt as to
which side would carry the day, and by the end of 1642 the Lower
House was triumphant all along the line. Understanding that discretion
was the better part of valour, the Lords freed Burlamachi
and dropped the contest. Warwick now petitioned the Lords again,
setting forth that he was the legal successor and assignee of Witherings.
Stanhope put in a counter-petition to the effect that Witherings
never had any right to the position which Warwick now
claimed. The House of Lords felt its own weakness too much to
interfere directly, but ordered the whole matter to trial.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Besides
Stanhope and Warwick, the following put in claims before the
Council of State: Henry Robinson, through the Porters, to whom
Stanhope had assigned; Sir David Watkins in trust for Thomas
Witherings, Jr., for the foreign office; Moore and Jessop through
Watkins and Walter Warde. Billingsley also, the old Postmaster
of the Merchant Adventurers, made a claim for the foreign office.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>The confusion in postal administration which naturally resulted
from the struggle among the rival claimants was increased by the
Civil War. In 1643 the Royal Court was moved to Oxford. The Secretaries
of State acting as Postmasters-General sent James Hicks,
the quondam servant of Prideaux, to collect arrears from the postmasters
due to the Letter Office. In addition to collecting the
money due, he was to require all postmasters on the road to Coventry
to convey to and from the Court all letters and packets on
His Majesty's service, to establish new stages, to forward the names
of those willing to supply horses and guides, and to report those
postmasters who were disobedient or disloyal.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> During the most
desperate period of the royal cause Hicks acted as special messenger
for the King, and apparently had some exciting experiences in
carrying the letters of his royal master. He lived to enjoy his reward
when the second Charles had come to his own. Parliament,
in the meantime, was establishing its control over the posts and
reorganizing the service. In the early period of Parliamentary
government, postal affairs were as a rule looked after by what
was known as the "Committee of Both Kingdoms," and the orders
which it issued were necessarily based upon political conditions.
Later the Postmaster-General acted under the Council of State or
under Cromwell himself. In 1644 the House of Commons issued an
order that protection should be granted to the postmasters between
London and Hull, to their servants, horses and goods.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The fact
that it was necessary to re-settle posts on the old established London-Berwick
road shows how demoralized conditions had been during
the conflict.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Many of the loyal postmasters were dismissed. Their
lukewarm conduct in supplying the messengers of the Commonwealth
with horses produced a reprimand from the Committee and
a sharp warning from Prideaux.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Posts were settled from London
to Lyme Regis for better communication with the southwestern
counties. In 1644 Edmund Prideaux was formally appointed
Postmaster-General.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> He was allowed to use as his office part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21">[21]</a></span>building occupied by the Committee of Accounts, formerly the
house of a London alderman.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> As long as the war continued it was
necessary that a close watch should be kept over letters passing by
post. Many of the new postmasters were military men and in addition
others were appointed in each town under the heading of
"persons to give intelligence."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> With the return of normal conditions
after 1649 Prideaux was ordered by the Council of State to
make arrangements for establishing posts all over England as in the
peaceful days before the war.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> His report of the same year to the
Council of State indicates the successful fulfilment of his instructions.
He said that he had established a weekly conveyance of
letters to all parts of the Commonwealth and that with the receipts
from private letters he had paid all the postmasters except those on
the Dover road.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>For the safety of the Commonwealth it was often found necessary
to search the letters. Sometimes the posts were stopped and all the
letters examined. When this was done, it was by order of the Council
of State, which appointed certain officials to go through the correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Sir Kenelm Digby, writing to Lord Conway from
Calais, asks him to direct his letters to that place, where they would
find him, "if no curious overseer of the packets at the post break
them open for the superscription's sake."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The Commonwealth
did openly and is consequently blamed for what had been done
more or less secretly by the Royal Government.</p>

<p>In 1651 the first proposal for farming the Post Office was submitted
to the Council of State. The Council reported the question
to Parliament but there is no evidence as to their attitude on the
question at that time.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The next year Parliament ordered that the
question of management, whether by contract or otherwise, should
be re-committed to the Council,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and in 1653 it was decided that it
would be better to let the posts out to farm. Prideaux had been
quietly dropped by the Council after making, as it was reported, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22">[22]</a></span>large fortune. When we remember that under his management
there was an annual deficit of £600 besides the expenses of the
Dover road and that in 1653 there was a net revenue of £10,000, it
seems probable that there is some truth in the report. The conditions
upon which the Post Office was farmed, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The farmers must be men of stability and good credit and must
be selected from those contracting. Official letters and letters from
and to members of Parliament must be carried free. All postage
rates must be fixed by the Council and not changed without its
consent. Finally all postmasters should be approved by the Council
and Lord Protector.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The policy of the Commonwealth in letting the posts out to farm
had much in its favour. The evil usually resulting from farming is
the temptation and the opportunity it offers for extortion from the
people. But in the case of the posts no oppression was possible, for
the farmer was limited in his charge to the rate fixed by the Government.
More than this, private control over the post office business
afforded what was most needed at the time, greater economy
and stricter supervision over the deputy postmasters. It was upon
the deputy postmasters alone that the farming system might exercise
undue pressure, but from them there was no complaint of the
withholding or reduction of wages until after Cromwell's death.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>John Manley was appointed "Farmer of the Posts" for two years
at a yearly rent of £10,000. There were at least four higher tenders
than his, and Manley contracted only for £8259. It was hinted that
Manley and the Council had come to a private agreement concerning
the rent to be paid.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In his orders to the postmasters, Manley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23">[23]</a></span>requested them to take particular care of government packets and
to see that no one was allowed to ride in post unless by special
warrant. All letters should be counted by them and the number
certified in London. They were to keep a sharp eye upon people,
especially travellers, and report any discontent or disaffection.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
In 1654 Manley's title of Postmaster-General was confirmed by
act of Parliament, the first act dealing directly with postal affairs.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
He was unsuccessful in having his franchise extended beyond the
original two years, and by order of the Council of State the management
of the Posts was entrusted to Mr. Thurloe, Secretary of
State, for £10,000 a year, the same amount which Manley had
paid.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after Thurloe had been appointed Postmaster-General,
general orders were issued by Cromwell to all the postmasters. He
forbade them to send by express any letters or packets except those
sent by certain officials on affairs of state, all others to await the
regular time for the departure of the mails. The old regulations for
providing mail-bags, registration of the time of reception, and the
like were repeated. The number of mails to and from London was
increased from one to three a week each way, and to ensure higher
speed, each postmaster was to provide a horse ready saddled and
was not to detain the mail longer than half an hour under any
consideration. He was ordered to deliver all letters in the country
at or near his stage and was to collect the postage marked on the
letter unless it was postpaid. The money so collected was to be
returned to London every three months.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>In 1657 the first act of Parliament was passed which fixed rates for
the conveyance of letters and established the system for the British
Islands. The preamble stated: "That whereas it hath been found by
experience that the writing and settling of one General Post Office ...
is the best means not only to maintain certain intercourse of trade
and commerce betwixt all the said places to the great benefit of the
people of these nations, but also to convey the public despatches
and to discover and prevent many dangerous and wicked designs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24">[24]</a></span>which have been and are daily continued against the peace and
welfare of this Commonwealth," it is enacted that there shall be one
General Post Office called the Post Office of England, and one Postmaster-General
nominated and appointed by the Protector for
life or for a term of years not exceeding eleven.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In accordance
with the terms of this act, Thurloe was appointed by Cromwell and
continued to act as Postmaster-General until the downfall of the
Commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>After the Restoration most of the old claimants to the Post
Office came to the front again. Stanhope besieged King and Parliament
for restoration to his old place. He seems to have received
some compensation, which he deserved for his pertinacity if for
nothing else. The Porters were up in arms at once, for he had promised
them to come to no agreement until they were satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
The two daughters of Burlamachi pleaded for some mark of favour,
on the ground that their father had ruined himself for the late King.
Frizell was still very much alive, and a nephew of Witherings carried
on the family feud.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In the meantime James Hicks was employed
by the Secretary of State to ascertain how many of the old deputy
postmasters were still eligible for positions. He reported that many
of them were dead and that many of those who were applying for
positions had been enemies of the King. For the time being it was
decided that the present officials should remain in office until a
settlement should be made.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Henry Bishop was appointed by royal patent Postmaster-General
of England for seven years at a rent of £21,500 a year. The
King agreed to persuade Parliament to pass an act<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> settling the
rates and terms under which Bishop was to exercise his duties. For
the time being he was to charge the same rates as those in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25">[25]</a></span>"pretended Act of 1657," to defray all postal expenses and to carry
free all public letters and letters of members of Parliament during
the present session. He agreed also to allow the Secretaries to
examine letters and not to change old routes or set up new without
their consent. He was to dismiss all officials whom they should
object to on reasonable grounds. If his income should be lessened
by war or plague or if this grant should prove ineffectual, the Secretaries
agreed to allow such abatement in his farm as should seem
reasonable to them.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Bishop's régime does not seem to have been
popular with the postmasters, for a petition in behalf of 300 of
them, representing themselves to be "all the postmasters in England,
Scotland, and Ireland," was presented to Parliament in protest
against the Postmaster-General's actions. They describe how
Cromwell had let the Post Office out to farm. They credit him with
respecting their rights and paying their wages. Lately, however,
Bishop had been appointed farmer, and unless they submitted to
his orders, they were dismissed at once. He had decreased their
wages by more than one half, made them pay for their places again,
and demanded bonds from them that they should not disclose any
of these things.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>In 1633, Bishop resigned his grant to Daniel O'Neale for £8000.
O'Neale offered £2000 and, in addition, promised £1000 a year,
during the lease, to Bennet, Secretary of State, if he would have the
assignment confirmed. He explained that this would not injure the
Duke of York's interest, who could expect no increase until the
expiration of the original contract, which still had four years and a
quarter to run.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> This refers to an act of Parliament which had just
been passed, settling the £21,500 post revenue upon the Duke of
York and his male heirs,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> with the exception of some £5000 which
had been assigned by the King to his mistresses and favourites.
O'Neale having died before his lease expired, his wife, the Countess
of Chesterfield, performed his duties until 1667.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>According to the grant made to O'Neale in 1663 no postmaster
nor any other person except the one to whom it was directed or
returned was to open any letter unless ordered so to do by an express
warrant from one of the Secretaries of State. If any letter was
overcharged, the excess was to be returned to the person to whom it
was directed. Nothing was said about letters which were lost or
stolen in the post. A certain John Pawlett complained that of sixteen
letters which he had posted not one was ever delivered in London
although the postage was prepaid.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Letters not prepaid were
stamped with the postage due in the London Office when they were
sent from London. Letters sent to London were charged by the
receiving postmaster in the country and the charge verified at the
London Office. An account was kept there of the amounts due and
the postmasters were debited with them, less the sum for letters not
delivered, which had also to be returned for verification.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> All this
meant losses to the postal revenue, but compulsory prepayment
would have been impracticable at the time. The postmasters had
nothing to gain by retaining letters not prepaid, but by neglecting
to forward prepaid letters, they could keep the whole of the postage,
for stamps were unknown. An incentive to the delivery of
letters was provided by the penny payment which it was customary
to give the postmasters for each letter delivered, over and
above the regular postage. The postmasters were required to remit
the postage collected to London every month and give bonds for
the performance of their duties.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The postal service was very much demoralized by the plague in
1665 and 1666 and the great fire which followed. Hicks, the clerk,
said that the gains during this time would be very small. To prevent
contagion the building was so "fumed" that they could hardly
see each other.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The letters were aired over vinegar or in front of
large fires and Hicks remarks that had the pestilence been carried
by letters they would have been dead long ago. While the plague
was still dangerous, the King's letters were not allowed to pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27">[27]</a></span>through London.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> After the fire the headquarters of the Post-Office
in London were removed to Gresham College.</p>

<p>When O'Neale's lease had expired in 1667, Lord Arlington, Secretary
of State, was appointed Postmaster-General.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The real head
was Sir John Bennet, with whom Hicks was entirely out of sympathy.
He accused Bennet of "scurviness" and condemned the
changes initiated by him. These changes were in the shape of reductions
in wages. The postmasters' salaries were to be reduced
from £40 to £20 a year. In the London Office, the wages of the
carriers and porters were also to be reduced.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the seventeenth century there were forty-nine
men employed in the Inland Department of the Post Office in London.
The Postmaster-General, or Controller as he was sometimes
called, was nominally responsible for the whole management although
the accountant and treasurer were more or less independent.
Then there were eight clerks of the roads. They had charge of the
mails coming and going on the six great roads to Holyhead, Bristol,
Plymouth, Edinburgh, Yarmouth, and Dover. The old veteran
Hicks had been at their head until his resignation in 1670. The
General Post Office building was in Lombard Street.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Letters might
be posted there or at the receiving stations at Westminster, Charing
Cross, Pall Mall, Covent Garden, and the Inns of Court. From
these stations, letters were despatched to the General Office twice
on mail nights. For this work thirty-two letter carriers were employed,
but they did not deliver letters as their namesakes now do.
The mails left London for all parts of the country on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday late at night or early the next morning.
On these days all officials had to attend at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and were generally
at work all night. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday when
the mails arrived from all parts of England they had to be on hand
at 4 or 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The postage to be paid was stamped on the letters
by the clerks of the roads. In addition three sorters and three window-men
were employed. The window-men were the officials who
stood at the window to receive the letters handed in and to collect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28">[28]</a></span>postage when it was prepaid. Then there were an alphabet-man,
who posted the names of merchants for whom letters had arrived,
a sorter of paid letters, and a clerk of undertaxed letters.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In the
Foreign Office, there were a controller, two sorters, an alphabet-man,
and eight letter receivers, of whom two were women. In addition
the Foreign Office had a rebate man who saw that overcharged
letters were corrected. Both offices seem to have shared the carriers
in common.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Before 1680 there was no post between one part of London and
another. A Londoner having a letter for delivery had either to take
it himself or send it by a special messenger. The houses were not
numbered and were generally recognized by the signs they bore or
their nearness to some public building. Such was the condition in
the metropolis when William Dockwra organized his London Penny
Post. On the first of April, 1680, London found itself in possession
of a postal system which in some respects was superior to that of
to-day. In the Penny Post Office as so established there were employed
a controller, an accountant, a receiver, thirteen clerks
in the six offices, and about a hundred messengers to collect and deliver
letters. The six offices were:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:1em">
The General Office in Star Court, Cornhill;<br />
St. Paul's Office in Queen's Head Alley, Newgate Street;<br />
Temple Office in Colchester Rents in Chancery Lane;<br />
Westminster Office, St. Martin's Lane;<br />
Southwark Office near St. Mary Overy's Church;<br />
Hermitage Office in Swedeland Court, East Smithfield.<br />
</p>

<p>There were in all about 179 places in London where letters might
be posted. Shops and coffee-houses were used for this purpose in
addition to the six offices, and in almost every street a table might
be seen at some door or shop-window bearing in large letters the
sign "Penny Post Letters and Parcels are taken in here." From
these places letters were collected every hour and taken to the
six main receiving-houses. There they were sorted and stamped
by the thirteen clerks. The same messengers carried them from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29">[29]</a></span>
the receiving-houses to the people to whom they were addressed.
There were four deliveries a day to most parts of the city and six
or eight to the business centres.</p>

<p>The postage fee for all letters or parcels to be delivered within
the bills of mortality was one penny, payable in advance. The
penny rate was uniform for all letters and parcels up to one pound
in weight, which was the maximum allowed. Articles or money to
the value of £10 might be sent and the penny payment insured their
safe delivery. There was a daily delivery to places ten or fifteen
miles from London and there was also a daily collection for such
places. The charge of one penny in such cases paid only for conveyance
to the post-house and an additional penny was paid on delivery.
From such places to London, however, only one penny was
demanded and there was no fee for delivery. The carriers in London
travelled on foot, but in some of the neighbouring towns they
rode on horseback.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Dockwra is credited with being the first to make use of post-marks.
All letters were stamped at the six principal receiving-offices
with the name of the receiving-office and the hour of their
reception. For instance, we have samples of letters post-marked
thus:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/img2.jpg" width="75%" alt="Postmarks" /></p>

<p>The first figure shows that they were Penny Post letters and that
they were prepaid. The "W" in the centre is the initial letter of
the receiving-office, Westminster. The second figure shows the
hour of arrival at the Westminster office, 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The earliest instance
of these marks is on a letter dated Dec. 9, 1681, written by
the Bishop of London to the Lord Mayor.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>Whenever letters came from any part of the world by the General
Post, directed to persons in London or in any of the towns
where the Penny Post carriers went, they were handed over to
these carriers to be delivered. In the same way, letters directed
to any part of the world might be left at any of the receiving-offices
of the Penny Post to be carried by its messengers to the General
Office. This must have increased greatly the number of letters
carried by the General Post. In the case of letters arriving by the
General and delivered by the Penny Post, the postage was paid on
delivery.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Over two hundred and thirty years ago then, London had
for a time a system of postal delivery not only unrivalled until a
short time ago, but in the matter of parcel rates and insurance not
yet equalled.</p>

<p>What was Dockwra's reward for the boon which he had conferred?
He himself says that it had been undertaken at his sole
charge and had cost him £10,000. It had not paid for the first few
months, and the friends who had associated themselves with him
fell away.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> As long as it produced no surplus, Dockwra was left to
do as he pleased, for the General Post was gaining indirectly from it.
As soon as it began to pay, the Duke of York cast his eye on it. In
1683 an action was brought against Dockwra for infringing upon
the prerogative of His Royal Highness, and the Duke won the case.
The Penny Post was incorporated in the General Post soon after.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
After William and Mary had come to the throne, Dockwra was
given a pension of £500 a year for seven years. At the end of that
time he was appointed manager of the Penny Post Department of
the General Post and his pension was continued for three years
longer. In 1700 he was dismissed, charged with "forbidding the
taking in of band-boxes (unless very small) and all parcels above
one pound in weight, with stopping parcels, and opening and detaining
letters."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Such was Dockwra's reward and such had been
Witherings'. He who would reform the Post Office must be prepared
to take his official life in his hands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>The transition between two reigns was usually a period of unrest
and disquietude, and the Revolution which resulted in the expulsion
of James was naturally accompanied by internal disorder.
For a time the posts suffered quite severely. The Irish and Scotch
mails were robbed several times and not even the "Black Box" escaped.
This was the box in which were carried the despatches between
Scotland and the Secretaries of State, the use of which was
not discontinued until after the accession of the new King and
Queen. After 1693 each Secretary was to send and receive his
own despatches separately and all expenses were to be met from
the proceeds of the London-Berwick post.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Major Wildman had
been appointed to the oversight of the Post Office, but held office
for a few months only, being succeeded in 1691 by Cotton and
Frankland. The Postmasters-General were henceforth to act under
the Lords of the Treasury.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Important improvements in the frequency and extension of
postal communication were inaugurated under the management of
Cotton and Frankland. It was, however, for the extension of the
foreign postal service and for that to Ireland and the plantations
that their administration is most notable.</p>

<p>On Monday and Thursday letters went to France, Italy, and
Spain, on Monday and Friday to the Netherlands, Germany,
Sweden, and Denmark. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,
mails left for all parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and there
was a daily post to Kent and the Downs. Letters arrived in London
from all parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, from Wales every Monday and from Kent
and the Downs every day. Besides the establishment of the General
Post in London, there were about 200 deputy postmasters employed
in England and Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The Irish Post was supervised
from London and during the Irish war its headquarters in Ireland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32">[32]</a></span>were transferred from Dublin to Belfast. It was directly managed
by a Deputy Postmaster-General, aided by ten or a dozen officials
and clerks. The net receipts were sent to England and the books
were audited by a deputy sent over by the Auditor-General of the
English Post.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>The Scotch Post Office was not in so good condition as the Irish.
The time when every Scotchman could read and write was yet very
far distant. The only post road of any importance was from Edinburgh
to Berwick and this had been established by the English.
For many years the vast majority of letters travelling over this
road were official despatches. After the crowns of England and Scotland
were united, it was necessary for the English Government to
keep in close touch with Scotland and "Black Box" made frequent
journeys between the two countries. The canny people in the north
had discovered a rich country to the south waiting to be exploited,
and the post horses between Edinburgh and London were kept
busy carrying the lean and hungry northern folk to the land of
milk and honey. Until 1695 the English and Scotch Post Offices
had been united under the English Postmaster-General with an
Edinburgh deputy; but by the Scotch act of 1695 the Post Office
of Scotland was separated from that of England. The terms of this
act were much the same as those of the English act of 1660, although
the rates established were somewhat higher. There was to
be a Postmaster-General living in Edinburgh, who was to have the
monopoly of carrying all letters and packets where posts were
settled.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The first proposal for a postal establishment in the American
colonies came from New England in 1638. The reason given was
that a post office was "so useful and absolutely necessary."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Nothing was done by the home government until fifty years later
when a proclamation was issued, ordering letter offices to be settled
in convenient places on the North American continent. Rates were
established for the continental colonies and Jamaica.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In 1691,
acting upon a report of the Governors of the Post-Office, the Lords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33">[33]</a></span>of Trade and Plantations granted a patent to Thomas Neale to
establish post offices in North America. About the same time an
act was passed by the Colony of Massachusetts appointing Andrew
Hamilton Postmaster-General. The Lords of Trade and Plantations
called attention to the fact that this act was not subject to the
patent granted to Neale. Matters were adjusted by Neale himself,
who appointed Hamilton his deputy in North America.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In 1699
a report was made by Cotton and Frankland to the Lords of the
Treasury based on a memorial from Neale and Hamilton. The
latter had established a regular weekly post between Boston and
New York and from New York to Newcastle in Pennsylvania. The
receipts had increased every year and now covered all expenses
except Hamilton's own salary, £200. Postmasters had been appointed
in New York and Philadelphia, Hamilton himself being in
Boston. The New York postmaster received a salary of £20 with
an additional £90 for carrying the mail half-way to Boston. The
Philadelphia postmaster was paid £10 a year.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The business of the Post Office was rapidly increasing. The same
decade that saw the establishment of the Board of Trade witnessed
also the organization of the Colonial Post. The expansion of English
commerce<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> necessarily reacted on communications both internal
and foreign, while the linking of the country posts with the
general system and the stimulus given by the London Penny Post
showed itself in the increased postal revenue.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The way was prepared
for the great expansion of the following century, an expansion
turned to account as a source of taxation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34">[34]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center"><b>THE POSTAL ESTABLISHMENT AN INSTRUMENT OF TAXATION</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>1711-1840</b></p>


<p>The year 1711 is an important landmark in the history of the
British Post Office. England and Scotland had united not only
under one king but under one Parliament, the war with France
made a larger revenue necessary, the growth of the Colonies required
better communication with the mother country and each
other, and it was highly expedient that certain changes in the policy
of the Post Office should receive parliamentary sanction. The act
of 1711 was intended to meet these conditions. The English and
Scotch Post Offices were united under one Postmaster-General in
London, where letters might be received from and sent to all parts
of Great Britain, Ireland, the colonies and foreign countries. The
postage rates were increased to meet the demand for a larger
revenue. In addition to the General Office in London, chief letter
offices were ordered to be set up in Edinburgh, Dublin, New York,
the West Indies, and other American colonies, and deputies were
appointed to take charge of them.</p>

<p>One of the most important clauses of this act, by providing regulations
for the management of the London Penny Post, finally
placed the seal of the approval of Parliament upon a branch of the
General Post, which had existed for nearly thirty years by virtue
of royal proclamations and legal decisions alone. A penny rate
was imposed upon all letters and packets passing by the Penny
Post in London, Westminster and Southwark to be received and
delivered within ten miles from the General Post Office building.
This would seem at first sight to be an improvement on the old custom,
by which a penny had carried only within the bills of mortality;
but as a matter of fact an extra penny was demanded on letters
delivered outside the bills and within the ten mile limit. Protest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35">[35]</a></span>
was, however, made against this as being illegal, and it was not
until 1730 that the custom was sanctioned.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>One other provision of the new act remains to be mentioned.
The last section forbade any official connected with the Post Office
from meddling in politics.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The system of party government
which had begun to take form during William and Mary's reign,
was developing. Under Anne, the Whigs had been the war party,
the expansionists, while the Tories were anxious for peace. So different
were their policies that Marlborough had gone over to the
Whigs. But the Queen and probably the majority of the people
were tired of war. Godolphin, the great financier, had given way
to Harley and the general election was favourable to the Tories.
Frankland had died before the act was passed, but Cotton, who
was a member of Parliament, preferred to keep his position in the
Post Office and accordingly accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. A
Mr. Evelyn was associated with him as Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>Shortly after his appointment the attention of the department
was directed to a weakness in administrative control which had
already resulted in considerable financial loss. The Postmasters-General
had always experienced considerable difficulty in collecting
the postage on bye and cross road letters.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Since these letters
did not reach London, no check was possible to ascertain whether
the postmaster transmitted to headquarters the full amount of
the postage collected on them. The difficulty had been met before
1711 by farming a large number of the country post offices.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> In
1711 the leases under which the farmers had held office were cancelled
and all the posts in the kingdom came again under the direct
oversight of the Postmasters-General. The old farmers were made
managers, with an allowance of 10 per cent from the net proceeds
of the posts under their control, and the deputy postmasters were
again paid directly by the state. The Government had refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36">[36]</a></span>o appoint surveyors when the act of 1711 was drafted and for a
time these managers acted in that capacity.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The experiment was
not a success and the Postmasters-General were at their wits' end
to know what to do to save the revenue which was being diverted
to the pockets of the country postmasters.</p>

<p>The country was happily spared any new device on their part,
for in 1721 a man came forward with a proposal to take all the losses
upon himself or rather to prevent them entirely. This was Ralph
Allen, whose name is worth remembering, not as a reformer but as
a good business man who came to the rescue of the postal revenue
at a rather critical time. He was the son of an innkeeper at St.
Blazey. At an early age we find him living with his grandmother,
the postmistress of St. Columb. He came under the notice of one
of the surveyors there on account of the neatness with which he
kept the accounts for his grandmother. When he was old enough,
he was appointed to a position in the Post Office at Bath and in
time was made postmaster there. Tradition has it that during the
insurrection of 1715 he informed the authorities that a wagon load
of arms was on its way from the West for the use of the rebels and
that this led to his preferment.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> He offered to farm the cross and
bye posts throughout the kingdom. The net product from these
posts amounted to £4000 in 1719. Allen offered to pay half as much
again and meet all expenses. The offer was accepted, and in 1721
he was given the lease of the cross and bye posts for a period of
seven years. The rent was fixed at £6000 a year in accordance
with the agreement. For the first quarter, the receipts exceeded
expectations, but later the postmasters began to relapse into their
old ways. In addition, the contract was rather hard on Allen, as
£300 of the £4000 nominally received by the Post Office was for
letters not delivered and hence not paid for. After the third year,
matters began to improve and the receipts increased greatly. The
contract was renewed for terms of seven years, until Allen's death
in 1769, and the rent was increased at each renewal.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>How did he succeed when so many others had failed? In the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37">[37]</a></span>
place he introduced the use of post bills and every postmaster had
to distinguish on these bills the bye letters from all others. The
voucher, which he also introduced, seems to have been only an acknowledgment
of the amount to be collected by each postmaster.
Besides this, Allen had a most intimate knowledge of the various
post towns in the kingdom, of their importance and of the number
of letters which might naturally be expected to pass between them.
He based his conclusions upon quite obvious considerations. Between
any two towns of much the same importance he expected
about the same correspondence, that it would not vary much, and
that the letters received and despatched would pretty well equal
each other.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>When Allen's contract was renewed in 1741 it was proposed that
he should be obliged to settle and support at his own charge posts
six days a week instead of the former tri-weekly posts between London,
Cambridge, Lynn, Norwich, and Yarmouth and from London
to Bath, Bristol, Gloucester, and intermediate towns. This was not
done at once, but during the next few years this proposition was
put into effect.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> In 1734, in addition to his cross and bye post letters,
Allen undertook to pay for the improvements which he had
made in the conveyance of country letters.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> He pointed out at the
same time that there was some opposition between the two parts
of his contract, since country and cross post letters interfered more
or less with each other.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Allen died in 1769, being worth, according to current report,
£500,000. Lewins says that he made £12,000 a year from his farm.
Probably both statements are exaggerated, but it is certain that he
accumulated a respectable fortune while managing the bye and
cross posts.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>There had been a considerable increase in the staff of the General
Office and many improvements introduced since 1711. At the head
of the office were two Commissioners called Postmasters-General,
each with a salary of £2000, assisted by a Secretary and four clerks.
There were in addition a Receiver-General, an Accountant-General,
a Solicitor, a Resident-Surveyor, and two inspectors of missent
letters. In addition to the Penny Post carriers, who were employed
also by the General Post, there were a Court Messenger and a carrier
for the House of Commons. At the General Office, letters were
taxed and sorted by the "Clerks of the Road" and their assistants
and by seventeen sorters. The window-man and alphabet-keeper
received the money on prepaid letters and posted lists of those for
whom letters had arrived. Undertaxed letters from the country
were re-taxed by the "Clerks of the Road." Besides the receiving-houses
of the Penny Post where all letters might be posted, there
were thirty receiving-houses for the General Post. Letters were
conveyed from these to the central office by sixty-nine carriers.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Letters were sent every night to the principal South and Midland
towns of England. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,
there were mails for all parts of England and Scotland and on
Tuesday and Saturday for Ireland and Wales. On Monday and
Thursday, letters were sent to France, Spain, and Italy, on Monday
and Friday to Germany, Flanders, Sweden, and Denmark, and on
Tuesday and Friday to Holland. Letters arrived in London every
day from the South and Midland towns, on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday, from all parts of England and Scotland, and on
Monday and Friday from Ireland and Wales.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> It will be seen
from this that the improvements in postal communications, which
had taken place since the beginning of the century, had been confined
to the South and Midland towns of England and to foreign
countries.</p>

<p>With the foregoing enlargement of postal facilities an old grievance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39">[39]</a></span>on the part of the public began to assume an acute form.
It had always been a debated question as to how far the postmasters
were responsible for the delivery of letters. There was no
general rule upon the question and the practice varied in different
parts of England. Although the towns on the post roads were
fairly well off as far as their letters were concerned, it was different
with those places which were neither on the great roads nor on the
bye-roads leading off from them. The mails for such places were
left at the nearest post towns and were conveyed to their destination
by carriers and messengers. Cotton and Frankland stated
that in addition to collecting the regular postage, they demanded
for this service an extra payment of 3<i>d.</i>, 6<i>d.</i>, and sometimes 12<i>d.</i>
It was proposed in 1699 that the delivery should be made by persons
appointed to collect as well as to deliver all letters and parcels.
For this they were allowed to take one penny or whatever the
people wished to give them.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In Sandwich the cross and bye post
letters had always been delivered free, although a fee was charged
for the London letters. The postmaster there decided to charge
for all letters, and the inhabitants of Sandwich protested. The case
was carried to the courts and the Post Office lost. Sandwich, however,
was a place where there had been a free delivery of part of
the letters at least. The Postmasters-General were very much disturbed
at this decision and still more disturbed lest the courts might
decide for free delivery in other post towns, which had always paid.
They resolved to bring on a test case. The town of Hungerford in
Berkshire was chosen, as it could be proved that the postmaster of
that place had received a penny for each letter delivered since the
beginning of the century. The case came before the Court of King's
Bench, Lord Mansfield presiding, and the Post Office lost again.
This case was decided in 1774, and the next year the "Liverpool
Advertiser" records a complaint to the Postmasters-General
that there was only one letter carrier in Liverpool. The reply
was that only one carrier was maintained in any provincial town
and that Liverpool could expect no better treatment.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>At the same time that the Post Office received this adverse decision
it had begun to suffer severely from the illegal carriage of
letters by the post coaches. These post coaches were so called
merely because they were most numerous on the post roads. John
Palmer, the proprietor of a theatre in Bath, pointed out to the
Postmasters-General that the coaches were speedier and cheaper
than the post boys who carried the mails on horseback and proposed
that he should be allowed to establish mail coaches and thus save
the postage on letters illegally carried by the post coaches. His
coaches were to be protected by a guard, presumably a retired soldier,
who was to be armed with two guns and to sit facing the road
in front of him. The driver was to carry pistols. No outside passengers
were to be carried, since they impeded the guard in performing
his duties. The speed was to be not less than eight or
nine miles an hour, twice as fast as the post boys travelled. In
addition the mails were to leave London at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> instead of after
midnight. The coaches were all to leave London together and return
together as far as possible. To insure this they were not to
wait for government letters when the latter were delayed.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The first mail coach ran between London and Bristol in 1784.
It was furnished by contractors at a cost of 3<i>d.</i> a mile. This was
the initial cost, however, and by 1797, the rate had been reduced
to a penny a mile each way. In the early part of August, 1784, there
was only one mail coach. At the end of the same month, coaches
went to Norwich, Nottingham, Liverpool, and Manchester. During
the next year they were sent to Leeds, Gloucester, Swansea, Hereford,
Milford, Worcester, Birmingham, Shrewsbury, Holyhead,
Exeter, Portsmouth, and other places. In 1786 they ran between
London and Edinburgh. In 1797 there were forty-two mail coach
routes established, connecting sixty of the most important towns
in the kingdom, as well as intermediate places. These coaches
travelled a total distance of 4110 miles and cost the Government
£12,416 a year, only half the sum paid for post horses and riders
under the old system. The coaches made daily journeys over
nearly two thirds of the total distance traversed and tri-weekly
journeys over something less than one third the total distance. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41">[41]</a></span>remainder travelled one, two, four, and six times a week. The result
of the establishment of these mail coaches was summed up by a
Parliamentary committee in the following words: "They have
lessened the chance of robbery, diminished the need for special
messengers and expresses, and now carry the letters formerly sent
by post coaches."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Palmer had been appointed Controller-General of the Post
Office and had chosen as his assistant a man by the name of Bonner.
Palmer himself was of a violent and headstrong disposition, and as
ill-luck would have it, Walsingham, one of the Postmasters-General,
was as masterful as himself. Palmer considered that his office
was outside the scope of Walsingham's authority, and although he
failed in making his position absolutely free from the control of the
Postmasters-General, yet he heeded them as little as possible. He
organized a newspaper department without consulting his superiors
and paid no attention to them when an explanation was asked.
He stirred up the London merchants to complain about the late
delivery of their letters, a delay which he had probably brought
about intentionally. A mail coach had been ordered by Walsingham
to carry the King's private despatches while His Majesty was
taking the waters at Cheltenham. This was done without consulting
Palmer, who was so indignant that he persuaded the contractor
to send in an enormous bill for supplying the coach. All
this came out through the treachery of Bonner, who owed his advancement
entirely to the friend whom he betrayed. He went so
far as to hand over to the Postmasters-General the private letters
which Palmer had written him. Palmer was dismissed in 1792 with
a pension.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>At the time of Palmer's appointment, a Treasury warrant had
been issued for the payment to him of £1500 a year and 2 per cent
of the increase from the Post Office revenue, but this warrant had
been pronounced illegal by the Attorney-General. Through Pitt's
influence, Palmer finally obtained £1500 a year and 2 per cent on
any increase in net revenue over £240,000 a year. Palmer objected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42">[42]</a></span>
to this on the ground that the old net revenue was only £150,000 a
year, but Pitt replied that the increased rates of 1784 would produce
at least £90,000. It is improbable, however, that the new
rates produced the increase estimated. In 1797 Palmer presented
a petition to the House of Commons, asking for the arrears
due him according to his method of estimating the increase in
net revenue, upon which his percentage was due. He said that
before his system was introduced the gross product of the Post
Office was decreasing at the rate of £13,000 a year. This was not
true. He claimed that the increase after 1784 was wholly due
to his own reforms, taking no account of the increased rates and
the industrial expansion of England. No action was taken by
Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>One of the arguments advanced by Palmer for the use of mail
coaches was their security against robbers. Previous to and during
the rebellion of 1745 numerous attempts were made to rob the
mails, and many of them were successful. These robberies occurred
principally at night. It was said that the mails were carried by boys
not always of the best character, and that very often they were in
league with the robbers. The Postmasters-General asked for soldiers
to patrol the roads where these robberies were the most frequent.
This was the method which Cromwell had used to protect
the mails. The request does not seem to have been granted, but in
1765 the death penalty was imposed for robbing the mail and for
stealing a letter containing a bank note or bill. Any post boy deserting
the mail or allowing any one but the guard to ride on the
horse or carriage with the mails was liable to commitment to hard
labour.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Palmer's prediction was fulfilled by the comparative
safety with which the mails were carried after his coaches had come
into use.</p>

<p>Charles, Earl of Tankerville, and Lord Carteret had been the
Postmasters-General in 1782 and 1783. On the fall of Shelburne's
ministry in the latter year, Tankerville left the Post Office, but
Carteret still remained. So far these two men had worked together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43">[43]</a></span>fairly well, although Tankerville had a suspicion that his
colleague had been engaged in some doubtful transactions. In
1784, when Pitt became Prime Minister, Tankerville was restored
to his old office. In the same year a transaction came under his
notice which aroused his suspicion. A Mr. Lees had been appointed
Secretary of the Irish Post Office. The man who had held this position
was made agent of the Dover packet boats, the old agent having
been superannuated. The new agent agreed to pay to his predecessor
the full amount of the salary coming to the place, while he
himself was to be paid by Mr. Lees the total salary coming to the
Secretary in Ireland. So far there was nothing uncommon about
the arrangement. The unusual part of the agreement and the part
which attracted Tankerville's attention was Lees' promise to pay
the money to "A. B.," an unknown person, after the old agent's
death. Suspicion pointed to Carteret as the man to whom the
money was to be paid. Lees himself denied this, but did not say
who "A. B." was.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>In 1787 a Mr. Staunton, the postmaster of Islesworth, a position
worth £400 a year, was in addition appointed Controller and Resident
Surveyor of the Bye and Cross Posts, to which was attached
a salary of £500, coals and candles and a house. The First Lord of
the Treasury proposed that the house should not go with the office,
and Carteret decided that Staunton should receive an extra £100
a year in lieu of the house. Tankerville refused to agree to this, and
the contention became so warm that the whole matter was referred
to Pitt, who, rather than lose Carteret's political support, dismissed
Tankerville.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Tankerville at once demanded an investigation,
which was granted. The results showed the Post Office to be in
a deplorable state. Tankerville was completely exonerated, but
failed to obtain much sympathy on account of the violence of his
attack upon Pitt and Carteret. It came out in the investigation
that "A. B." was a foreigner named Treves, who had no claim on the
Post Office or any other department of the government except that
he was a friend of Carteret. Carteret himself knew the condition
of his appointment, but had done nothing except to express himself
displeased with the whole arrangement. A payment of £200 a year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44">[44]</a></span>had also been exacted from Mr. Dashwood, Postmaster-General
of Jamaica, as the condition of his appointment, and that too had
gone to Treves. The agent at Helvoetsluys had been allowed by
Carteret to sell his position to a man as incapable as himself. Staunton's
office had been abolished soon after his appointment, and he
had been allowed to retire at the age of forty years with a pension
of £600 a year in the face of the rule that officers of an advanced
age and after long service were allowed upon retirement to receive
only two thirds of their salaries.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The Postmasters-General had received in 1783, in addition to
their salaries, over £900 for coals. They had also received £694 for
candles during two years and a half and £150 for tinware for the
same period. Tankerville had taken his share of these perquisites,
but it is only fair to add that Carteret's emoluments exceeded his
by £213 for the periods under consideration. It had become customary
to receive a money payment in place of a large part of their
supplies. In 1782 the total sum going to the officials of the General
Office amounted to £28,431, of which sum about £10,000 were
placed under the heading of emoluments other than salaries.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Of
all the departments of the Post Office, the Sailing Packet Service
was the one most in need of reform.</p>

<p>The light, which was then let in among the dark places of the
Post Office, had a most excellent effect. Acting on the report furnished
by the committee of the House, a new establishment was
effected in 1793. The reforms were approved by the Postmasters-General
and carried out under the direction of the Lords of the
Treasury. The good work had been begun in 1784 by Palmer. He
had appointed additional clerks, letter carriers, surveyors and
messengers, had established new offices, and had increased the inadequate
pay of minor officials. This had entailed an increase of
£19,022 in expenses in the General and Penny Posts, but the increase
was justified by increased efficiency and by larger returns
from the conveyance of letters. Of the total increase, £11,451 had
been spent on the General Office and £7571 on the Penny Post, to
which had been added eighty-six more letter carriers for London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45">[45]</a></span>and seventy-eight more for the suburbs, as well as some supernumerary
carriers.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The reforms introduced in 1793 may be grouped
under three heads: regulations respecting fees and emoluments,
abolition of some offices and an increase in officers and clerks in
others; regulation of official business. The regulations respecting
fees and emoluments were necessarily negative in their character.
The most important were as follows: The postmasters were no
longer to pay fees to the Postmasters-General on the renewal of the
bonds given by their securities. The two per cent allowed to the
Scotch Deputy Postmaster-General on all remittances from Scotland
was discontinued and a compensation for life was granted instead.
The fees for tinware were abolished, and the pension to the
New York agent was to cease. No postal official was allowed to own
shares in the sailing packets, and with a few minor exceptions all
salaries were henceforth to be in lieu of every emolument or fee.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>A number of sinecure and useless offices were abolished. The
chief among them were: Jamineau's perquisite office which had
the monopoly of selling newspapers to the "Clerks of the Roads," the
Secretary's position as agent for the packets, the Controller of
the Bye and Cross Posts, the Inspector of Dead Letters in the Bye
Letter Office, the Collector in the Bye Letter Office, the Secretary
of the Foreign Office, and the Controller of the Inland Office.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The changes in business regulations were as follows: The Postmasters-General
were no longer to include legal charges, chaise
hire, and pensions under the head of dead letters. The Postmasters-General's
warrant must be entered previous to any money being
paid. The payment of debts must be enforced. The West India
accounts should be sent to the deputy there every quarter. The
payments to mail coach contractors must be made directly by
warrant instead of through the Controller-General. No change was
made in the anomalous position of the Accountant-General. He
was supposed to be a check upon the Receiver-General, but had to
depend upon the Receiver-General's books for verifying the remittances
from the deputies.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The Englishman's belief in the sanctity of vested interests has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46">[46]</a></span>usually been too strong to permit any abridgment of rights or
privileges without compensation. Those postal officials who had
been dismissed or whose sinecure offices had been abolished were
not to be turned entirely adrift. Provision was made for pensioning
most of them. Before the reform the total sum paid by the Post
Office in pensions was £1500. The incumbrances dismissed were
allowed £6101, and between 1793 and 1797 £1475 more were
added to the pension list. It was pointed out at the time that it was
far better to pension them off and leave them to die than to continue
them in service. In 1797 it was a relief to be able to announce
"that already £648 had been saved from dead and promoted pensioners."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>The report of the committee which had been appointed at Tankerville's
suggestion is silent on the question of the opening and detention
of letters. It had been provided by the act of 1711 that no
letters should be opened or detained except under protection of an
express warrant from one of the Secretaries of State. The Royal
Commission of 1844 reported that from 1712 to 1798, the number
of warrants so issued was 101, excluding those which were well
known or easily ascertained. The Secretary of State for the Inland
Department issued most of them. From 1798 to 1844, 372 warrants
were issued, many of them being general warrants and often
for very trivial causes. At the trial of Bishop Atterbury, the principal
witnesses against him were Post Office clerks, who had opened
and copied letters to and from him, under warrant from one of the
Secretaries.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In addition to this regular method for intercepting letters, a
particular department had been in existence for some time with
no other duties than to examine letters. Strictly speaking it had
nothing to do with the Post Office and was supported entirely from
the "Secret Service Fund." The truth about it came out in the
examination of the conduct of Sir Robert Walpole by the "Committee
of Secrecy." From 1732 to 1742, £45,675 had been spent
upon this department. It had originated in 1718 and the expenses
<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>for that year were only £446, but by 1742 they had increased more
than tenfold. The Secretary of the Post Office in giving his evidence
before the committee, said that this office received instructions
from the Secretaries of State and reported to them. The working
force consisted of a chief decipherer, assisted by his son and three
other decipherers, five clerks, the Controller of the Foreign Office,
a doorkeeper and a former alphabet keeper. Either considerable
business was transacted there or it was a retreat for useless officials.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>An account is given in Howell's "State Trials" of the trial of
Hensey and of the practice then in vogue for finding treasonable
correspondence. His letters were handed over for investigation to
the Secretary of State by a Post Office clerk. This clerk in giving
his evidence said that when war was declared against any nation,
the Postmasters-General issued orders at once to stop all suspected
letters. These orders were given to all the Post Office clerks
and letter carriers. Such instructions can only be justified as a
war measure, for the act of 1711 had provided that no letter
should be detained or opened unless by express warrant from one
of the Secretaries of State for every such detention or opening.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>We find very few complaints about the opening of letters during
the second half of the eighteenth century. On the other hand it
must be confessed that letters were at times opened and searched
merely to learn the beliefs and plans of political opponents. It is
difficult to determine to how great an extent this practice was
prevalent as there seems little doubt that the complainants may
occasionally have been prompted by their own vanity to believe
that their correspondence had been tampered with.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> In 1795, during
the great war with France, the Government ordered all letters
directed to the United Provinces to be detained. The question
then was, what was to be done with them? None of them seems to
have been opened and the cause for their detention was only to
prevent any information being given to the enemy. Accordingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48">[48]</a></span>by an act of Parliament passed in the same year, the Post Office was
empowered to return them to the writers.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Although the larger part of the fees and emoluments enjoyed by
the postal officials had been abolished in 1793, the proceeds from
those which were left continued to increase steadily. By far the
most lucrative was the privilege of franking newspapers, within the
kingdom, to the colonies, and to foreign countries. Ever since newspapers
had been printed, the "Clerks of the Roads" had been allowed
to send them to any part of the kingdom without paying
postage. After 1763, when members of Parliament were allowed
the same privilege, every one felt at liberty to make use of a member's
frank for this purpose, and the Clerks suffered accordingly.
Newspapers to the Colonies were franked by the Secretary of the
Post Office and produced a revenue of £3700 in 1817, all of which
went to Sir Francis Freeling who was then Secretary. In 1825 the
privilege of franking papers within the kingdom and to the colonies
was withdrawn, but compensation was granted to Sir Francis.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
This did not end the trouble, for the Clerks still acted as newspaper
venders. On account of their official position they were able to post
them until 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, while the regular newsvenders were allowed to
do so only until 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> at the Lombard Street Office and 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> at
the General Office or they must pay a special fee of a halfpenny on
each.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Mr. Hume, the member for Montrose, brought the case before
the House, and in 1834 all Post Office officials were forbidden
to sell newspapers. At the same time the officials in the Foreign
Office lost the right to frank papers to any foreign country.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The members of the Secretary's office had, since 1799 and 1801,
issued two official publications, which paid no postage. These were
called the "Packet List" and the "Shipping List." The first of
these contained all the intelligence received at the Post Office
concerning the sailing packets. The second contained information
about private vessels, furnished principally by "Lloyds." The
Commissioners commented upon this practice in very uncomplimentary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49">[49]</a></span>language.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> In addition, the members of the Secretary's
department received fees on the deputations granted to new
postmasters in England and Wales, upon commissions granted to
agents and postmasters abroad, upon private expresses to and from
London, and upon news supplied to the London press during a
general election.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In 1837 the fees on deputations and commissions
were abolished, private expresses were discontinued, the "Shipping
List" was discontinued, and the "Packet List" passed from the
control of the Post Office. The revenue from these fees in the Secretary's
Office which were still continued was to go henceforth to
the general revenue.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>An extra charge of 6<i>d.</i> was demanded upon letters posted between
7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> This had been the rule since 1800, and the
proceeds went either to the Inland or Foreign Office. So also did
the registration fees on ships' letters. These fees were transferred
to the general revenue in 1837.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> In 1827 the total amount received
in fees, emoluments, and gratuities by the officials in the London
Office was £23,100, by agents and country postmasters £16,500.
Most of these were either abolished or transferred to the general
revenue in 1837.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of the Post Office during the eighteenth
century was the extension of its service, which accompanied
the industrial expansion of the kingdom. The abuses which naturally
flourish during a prosperous period had been largely remedied
by the reform of 1793. The nation's need for a larger revenue led
not only to a great increase in postage rates but also to stricter economy
in the organization of the Post Office. The London and Dublin
Penny Posts were reformed and extended, the work of the General
and Penny Posts in London was harmonized, the employees were
increased, and the new departments which had been established
were reformed and consolidated.</p>

<p>The Newspaper Office which had been illegally established by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50">[50]</a></span>Palmer was continued after his dismissal. Walsingham had objected
to it on the ground that Palmer had no right to appoint any
officials without his consent. Previously all newspapers had been
forwarded to the postmasters free of postage by the "Clerks of the
Roads." Now that they might be sent with the letters, they were
brought in at the last moment still wet from the press so that they
defaced the writing on the letters sent in the same bag.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> In 1784 a
Dead Letter Office was also established. Previously, dead and missent
letters had been handed to a clerk in the General Office. During
Allen's farm of the cross and bye post letters, missent letters
were no longer forwarded to London, but any postmaster, into
whose hands they came, was instructed to place them on the right
track.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Four years later a third office was instituted, a Money
Order Office. No order could be issued for more than five guineas
and the fee for that sum was 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> It was started as a private speculation
by some of the postal officials and so remained until 1838
when it was taken over by the General Post Office.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>The policy of the Post Office with reference to the registration of
letters containing valuables varied with the nature of the enclosure
and the manner in which it was sent. On ships' letters sent from
England, the registration fee was one guinea, and a receipt was
given to the person sending a registered letter. The fee for a letter
coming into the kingdom was only 5<i>s.</i><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> If bank notes were enclosed
in a letter, it received no special attention from the Post Office.
If gold or silver was sent in a letter marked "money letter," the
postmaster placed it in a separate envelope and made a special
entry on the way bill, which was repeated at every office it passed
through. No special fee was charged for the extra attention bestowed
upon these letters until 1835 when the Postmaster-General
was allowed to charge a fee for their registration in addition to the
ordinary postage.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The Money Order Department, still a private
undertaking, had its fees reduced from 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> on sums not exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51">[51]</a></span>
£2 and from 18<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> on sums exceeding £2 but not
more than £5.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>At the same time that the General Post was being reformed, a
former letter carrier by the name of Johnson was improving the
Penny Post. The six principal receiving-houses which Dockwra had
instituted had been reduced to five and were now still further reduced
to two. The subsidiary receiving-houses in the shops and
coffee-houses were increased and the number of letter carriers more
than doubled. Six regular deliveries for the city proper and three
for the suburbs were introduced. Before 1793 the deliveries in the
city had not been made at the same time, for the carriers had to go
to one of the main receiving-houses to get their letters. The deliveries
were now made as near the same time as possible all over the
city and the delivery hours were posted so that people might know
when to expect the carriers and thus act as a check upon them.
Mounted messengers conveyed the letters to those carriers who
delivered in distant parts of the city.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>In 1794 an act was passed "to regulate the postage and conveyance
of letters by the carriage called the Penny Post." The rate for
letters posted in London, Westminster, Southwark and the suburbs
for any place within these places and their suburbs remained
one penny. Letters sent from these places to any place outside paid
2<i>d.</i> as before. Hitherto letters sent from outside to London, Westminster,
Southwark and the suburbs had paid only one penny.
This was raised by the act of 1794 to 2<i>d.</i> It was also provided that
the postage for Penny Post letters need not be paid in advance.
This would increase the expense but the idea was probably to
secure greater safety in the delivery of letters. Finally, the surplus
revenue at the end of each quarter was to be considered part of the
revenue of the General Post.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The changes introduced by Johnson and the act of 1794 were in
the right direction. This seems a reasonable conclusion not so much
on account of the increase in net product, which was not great, as
on account of the increase in gross product, showing that the number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52">[52]</a></span>of letters and parcels sent by the Penny Post had doubled. The
financial condition of the Penny Post before and after the reform
is shown by the following figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>London was not the only place which could boast a Penny
Post in 1793. The system was extended in that year to Edinburgh,
Manchester, Bristol, and Birmingham, while Dublin had been so
favoured since 1773. It is almost unnecessary to add that in all
these places, it was a pronounced success from a financial and social
point of view.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>In 1801 the London Penny Post which had lasted for 120 years
was practically swept out of existence, for 2<i>d.</i> was then charged
where a penny had formerly been the rate. An exception was made
in the case of letters passing first by the General Post, for on these
the old rate still held.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Four years later, the limits of the Twopenny
Post, as it was called, were restricted to the General Post
Delivery and 3<i>d.</i> was charged for letters crossing the bounds of this
delivery. This was called the Threepenny Post.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> The effect of the
increased rates and the growth of population in the metropolis is
shown by the increase in gross receipts, which rose from £11,768 in
1703 to £96,089 in 1816 and to £105,052 in 1823. During the same
period, the number of letter carriers was increased from 181 to 235,
and nineteen officials were added to the establishment.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Although the General, the Twopenny, and the Threepenny Posts,
were all under one management, no attempt was made to harmonize
their methods of procedure until 1831. Letters for the General Post
were often entrusted to the Twopenny Post but the receiving-houses
of both Posts were frequently established in the same street and
close together. The General Post had seventy receiving-houses in
the city, the Twopenny Post 209, the Threepenny Post 200 more in
<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>the suburbs and adjoining country. In addition there were 110
"bellmen" who collected letters from door to door, ringing their
bells as they went. They charged one penny for each letter collected.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
The General Post receiving-houses closed at 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, the
Twopenny receiving-houses at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, but letters might be posted
at the Charing Cross Office until 8.30 and at the General Office
until 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span><a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there
were three deliveries, by the Inland, Foreign, and Twopenny Post
carriers. The limits of the Inland Post Delivery were very irregular
and left out a large part of the populous suburbs. The Foreign
Post Delivery was also very irregular and still more restricted in
area. The Twopenny Post Delivery included London, Westminster,
Southwark and their suburbs, and was the most extensive.
Letters were delivered by the Threepenny Post within an irregular
area bounded on the inside by the Twopenny Delivery and extending
nearly twelve miles from the General Post Office. The
separate delivery of foreign letters was abolished first and all foreign
letters were delivered by the General Post carriers, and in 1831
the deliveries of the General and Twopenny Posts were made co-extensive,
extending to a distance of three miles from the General
Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand. Three years later the Twopenny
Post building in Gerard Street was given up and all Twopenny
Post letters henceforth were sent to the General Post Office building
to be sorted.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The regular collections of Twopenny Post letters were made at
8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, 12 <span class="smcap">M.</span> and 2, 5 and 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Deliveries were made at
the same hours in the morning, at noon, and at 2, 4 and 7 o'clock
in the afternoon. A letter posted at or before 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> was sent for
delivery at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and so on. The letters collected were taken to
the General Office by horsemen to be sorted. Two sets of men were
employed, one collecting while the other delivered.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> There was an
additional "early delivery" as it was called. The carriers on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54">[54]</a></span>way to their own "walks" delivered letters to subscribers, who paid
5<i>s.</i> a quarter for the accommodation thus afforded. The postage for
letters so delivered was not paid until the carriers called again on
their regular delivery.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> In 1837 the times of the regular deliveries
were changed to every second hour from 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and collections
were made at the same hours.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> In the Threepenny Post
limits, there were on an average three deliveries a day but those
towns which had a General Post delivery received only two a day
from the Threepenny Post. Letters were sent by horsemen or mail
carts for delivery. The same receiving-houses were used for General
and Threepenny Post letters.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The Dublin Penny Post was remodelled in 1810. The deliveries,
which had been only two a day, were increased to four and then to
six, additional letter carriers were appointed and receiving-houses
established. The penny delivery extended to four miles around the
city. There was a 2<i>d.</i> rate for letters beyond the four mile radius.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Previous to 1835, the boundary of the Edinburgh Penny Post was
a circle with a radius of 1-3/8 miles from the Register Office. Some
Scotch mathematician must have been consulted when in 1835 the
boundary was made an ellipse with its foci a furlong apart, the
distance from each focus to the most remote part of the circumference
being 1-5/16 miles. Outside this ellipse, there was a 2<i>d.</i> rate.
There had been three deliveries a day, raised in 1838 to five.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Before 1837 Penny Posts had also been established in Newcastle
and Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Since nearly all the mail coaches left London at 8 o'clock in the
evening, most of the letters arriving there in the morning for outside
places were not despatched until the same evening. It was
pointed out by the commissioners in the Report of 1837 that a large
proportion of these letters might be forwarded by the post coaches.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55">[55]</a></span>
If they arrived on Saturday morning they were not forwarded until
Monday evening since Sunday was not a mail day and mail coaches
arriving on Sunday were detained in the outskirts of the city.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
The rumour that the Post Office was considering the expedience of
a Sunday Post brought forth a flood of protests. Bankers, merchants,
vestries, and religious societies were represented by delegations
and petitions to the Postmaster-General and the House of
Commons, praying that no change might be made.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Sixteen hundred
solicitors joined in the opposition. Lord Melbourne informed
the Bishop of London that the subject was not under consideration,
and the Chancellor of the Exchequer told Sir Robert Inglis
that the Government had no intention of opening the Post Office
on Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Derby had a Sunday delivery in 1839, but, on their
own request, many of the inhabitants were excluded from it.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>For over forty years all the mail-coaches in England were provided
by one man, with whom a new contract was made every
seven years. Before 1797 a penny a mile was paid each way but on
the imposition of a tax on carriages, the rate was raised to 1&#189;<i>d.</i>,
then to 1&#190;<i>d.</i>, and later to 2-1/8<i>d.</i> a mile. One contractor supplied the
coaches, others provided horses and drivers, but the guards were
hired directly by the Post Office. In Scotland and Ireland, coaches,
horses, and drivers were all provided by the same men. The number
of miles a day covered by the mail-coaches in 1827 was 7862
and the mileage allowance for that year was £46,900. When the
mails were exceptionally heavy, mail carts were used, which cost
somewhat more than the coaches, since they carried no passengers.
In 1836 the contract for the supply of coaches was thrown open to
public competition. By this move, the expenses dropped from
£61,009 a year to £53,191 although the total distance travelled per
day increased from 13,148 to 14,482 miles.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The mail-coaches were
at a disadvantage in competing with the post-coaches, since the
former were allowed to carry no more than four inside and two outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56">[56]</a></span>passengers nor were they allowed to carry any luggage on the
roof.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> On the other hand the mail-coaches in England paid no
tolls until 1837.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The 268 mail guards of the British coaches
received £7577 in salaries in 1837, paid directly by the Post Office.
Seven inspectors were also employed at a fixed yearly salary and
15<i>s.</i> a day when travelling. They superintended the coachmen and
guards, investigated complaints, delays, and accidents, and made
preliminary agreements in contracting for coaches.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The majority
of the Irish coaches had paid tolls ever since they had been introduced.
Generally they were paid by the Post Office at stated intervals.
The total distance travelled by mail-coaches in Ireland in
1829 was 2160 miles each day, by mail-carts 2533 miles. The number
of guards employed was eighty-five, receiving £2935 a year.
The Irish coaches were allowed to carry four outside passengers.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The first railway in England over which mails were carried was
operated between Manchester and Liverpool. In 1838 the Government
paid the Grand Junction Railway 5-7/8<i>d.</i> a single mile for the
conveyance of its mails. At the same time the average rate by the
coaches was 2-1/8<i>d.</i> a single mile. On the London and Birmingham
Railway when a special Post Office carriage was used, 7&#189;<i>d.</i> was paid.
When the ordinary mail-coach was carried on trucks the rate was
4-1/4<i>d.</i> When a regular railway carriage was used, the rate was &#189;<i>d.</i> a
mile for one third of a carriage.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> For the year ending 5th January,
1839, the Post Office paid £105,107 for the conveyance of mails by
coaches and £9883 to the railways. For the next official year, the
figures had risen to £109,246 and £39,724.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>The increased business of the Post Office made necessary a corresponding
increase in the employees and better arrangements for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57">[57]</a></span>dealing with the reception and despatch of letters. The number of
persons employed in the General Office in 1804 was 486. In 1814
there were 576. There were 563 postmasters in England and over
3000 persons officially engaged in the receipt and delivery of letters.
Additional offices had also been established. In 1813 a Returned
Letter Office was organized for the purpose of returning undelivered
letters to the writers and collecting the postage due. Previous
to 1813, the practice had been to return only such letters as appeared
to contain money or were supposed to be important enough
to escape destruction. A Franking Department was organized to
inspect such letters as were sent free. The increased use of private
ships for conveying letters led to the establishment of a Ship Letter
Office.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>The old Post Office building in Lombard Street was quite too
small to provide for the new offices and employees. The Inland
Department contained only 3140 superficial feet, half of which
was occupied with sorting tables, leaving only 1500 feet for 130
persons. In the Foreign Department with thirty-five men, there
were only 250 superficial feet where they must perform their duties.
The accommodations for receiving letters were so inadequate that
when a foreign mail was being made up, the windows were crowded
with an impatient and seething mob waiting for their turn to post
their letters. The condition of the Penny Post Department was no
better. In 1814 a committee of the House of Commons reported
that a new General Post Office building was absolutely necessary.
Objections were raised on account of the necessary expenses involved
and it was not until 1829 that the new Post Office in St.
Martin's-le-Grand was formally opened.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>In 1784 Ireland was given much larger political powers than she
had previously enjoyed, and her Parliament was freed from the
direct tutelage of the English Privy Council. At the same time
greater latitude in postal matters was also granted. An Irish Postmaster-General
was appointed to reside in Dublin and to collect
the postage on all letters which did not pass beyond Ireland. The
postage between the two countries was to be collected on delivery,
<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>and then to be divided between the two according to the distance
travelled in each. All net receipts from the Irish Office were ordered
to be transmitted to London. The sailing packets remained
in the charge of the English Postmasters-General, but £4000 a
year was paid to the Irish Office for this privilege.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>After the separation of the Irish from the English Post Office,
different postage rates had been established for the two countries.
The division of authority thus established had caused endless difficulties.
Complaints about the delay or loss of letters crossing the
Channel at Kingstown, Howth, and Waterford were referred from
one office to the other. The Commissioners who inquired into the
condition of the Dublin Office found things in a deplorable condition.
There were nearly as many postal officials employed in Dublin
as in London, although the number of letters handled was not
one fourth so great. In the secretary's office, employing six persons,
the fees amounted to £2648 a year, largely on English and Irish
newspapers. In the whole Dublin establishment they averaged
over £15,000 a year. The contracts for the supply and horsing of
the mail-coaches were supposed to be public but they were awarded
by favour. The Postmasters-General did not attend to business
and were very jealous of each other. The Commissioners recommended
the amalgamation of the English and Irish offices, and this
was accomplished in 1831, the Irish postage rates having been altered
four years earlier to coincide with the English rates.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Ireland was divided into eight postal divisions, according to the
routes of the mail-coaches. Mails left Dublin at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> with an
additional mail for Cork at noon. They arrived in Dublin between
6 and 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The most important postal centres in addition to Dublin
were Belfast, Cork, Limerick, and the packet stations at Waterford
and Donaghadee. The total number of post towns in Ireland
was 414. At the same time there were in Great Britain 546 post
towns.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> A new post office building was completed in Dublin in 1821
at a cost of £107,000.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>The Scotch Post Office had been amalgamated with the English
Office in 1711, and Scotland was constituted one of the eighteen
postal divisions of Great Britain. The Scotch rates had been the
same as the English rates since that date, although an additional
half-penny was paid on Scotch letters to meet mail-coach tolls.
In 1821 there were only eight towns for which mails were made up.
At the same time that a new building for the use of the Post Office
was being erected in Dublin, a contract was signed for a new General
Office building for Edinburgh to cost £14,000.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>The rates established by the act of 1765 were still unchanged for
the colonial possessions of the United Kingdom. The American
dominions had been sadly depleted by the Revolutionary War but
the postage revenue from the loyal remnants had steadily increased.
In 1838 the amount of postage charged upon the colonial postmasters
in America amounted to £79,000. At one time Jamaica had
been the most important American colony from a postal point of
view. Canada now took the lead, followed in order of importance by
Jamaica, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. In 1834 it was provided
that, as soon as the North American Provinces passed postal
acts of their own and these acts were approved by the King, the
colonial rates of 1765 should cease and the net postal revenue of the
North American Provinces should be retained by them.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The British Post Office was now to experience the most far reaching
and vital change since 1635. Sir Rowland Hill was the representative
of the movement, aided by Mr. Wallace, who, as a member
of Parliament, was able to exercise an important effect upon
the proposed reform. The history of the adoption of penny postage
has been so well told by Hill himself that only a bare story of its
acceptance by Parliament is necessary here. A committee was appointed
to report upon the condition of the Post Office, the attitude
of postal officials and of the public towards the proposed change,
its effect upon the revenue, and finally to give their own opinion.
This committee examined the Postmaster-General,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> the Secretaries
and Solicitors of the London, Dublin, and Edinburgh offices,
<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>other officials in the Post Office, the Chairman, Secretary, and
Solicitor of the Board of Stamps and Taxes, Rowland Hill and
eighty-three other witnesses from different classes of people, and
obtained many reports from the Post Office. Hill presented his
plan to the Committee as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>That inland letters should pay postage according to weight at the
rate of one penny for each half ounce.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Such postage should be paid in advance by means of stamped
papers or covers.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>An option might be allowed for a time to pay a penny in advance
or 2d. on delivery.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Day mails should be established on the important lines of communication.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>There should be a uniform rate of postage because the cost of
distributing letters consisted chiefly in the expenses for collecting
and delivering them.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The plan then in operation for letters not
exceeding one ounce in weight was to charge according to the number
of enclosures. This plan was uncertain because the number
could not always be ascertained, necessitated a close examination,
and was evaded by writing several letters on one sheet.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Payment on delivery made it necessary to keep two separate accounts
against each postmaster, one for unpaid letters posted in
London, and one for paid letters posted in the country. The postmasters
had also to keep accounts against each other. Payment in
advance, if made compulsory, would do away with half of these
accounts and the use of stamped covers or paper would do away
with the other half.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> In some small places where the penny charge
would not cover the cost of delivery, Hill proposed that a small
additional charge be made, either in advance or on delivery, but he
withdrew this suggestion later.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>
<p>The witnesses summoned to give their evidence before the committee
pointed out that a multitude of business transactions were
not carried on at all, or were carried on clandestinely, or were hampered
by the high postage rates. Bills for small amounts were not
drawn,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> commercial travellers did not write until several orders
could be sent on one sheet of paper,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> samples were not sent by post,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
communication between banks and their branches was restricted,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
statistical information was denied,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> social correspondence restricted
especially among the poor,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> working men were ignorant of the rates
of wages in other parts of the country,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and the high postage was a
bad means of raising revenue.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> In order to estimate the probable
revenue after the change, it was necessary to know the number of
letters carried. Hill had come to the conclusion that the total number
was about 80,000,000 a year. The Secretary, Maberley, considered
that there were about 58,000,000. A return was called for
by the committee and Hill's estimate proved to be nearly correct.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The committee reported that the Post Office "instead of being
viewed as an institution of ready and universal access, distributing
equally to all and with an open hand the blessings of commerce and
civilization, is regarded as an establishment too expensive to be
made use of" (by large classes of the community) "and as one with
the employment of which they endeavour to dispense by every
means in their power." They were on less solid ground when they
proceeded to state that the idea of obtaining revenue had been
until lately only a minor consideration and that the Post Office had
primarily been established for the benefit of trade and commerce.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
Finally Hill's plan was approved, though only by the casting vote
of the chairman, Mr. Wallace.</p>

<p>The House of Commons received the proposed change with favour.
Over 300 petitions with 38,000 signatures were presented
praying for its adoption. The Duke of Richmond, a former Postmaster-General,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62">[62]</a></span>thought that it would be beneficial and that it was
the only means of stopping the illegal conveyance of letters.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Sir
Robert Peel was of the opinion that, with the prevailing deficits, it
was an unfortunate departure, and he feared that prepaid letters
would not be delivered.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> But the Treasury was given power to
lower rates and in 1840 a treasury warrant was issued, imposing
postage rates between the colonies and between foreign countries
through Great Britain according to weight and distance.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Stamped
covers were issued for the use of members of Parliament, and in
1840 an act was passed establishing penny postage for the United
Kingdom, permitting the use of stamped paper or covers, and
imposing rates on foreign and colonial letters according to weight
and distance conveyed.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The complete change thus produced in the policy of the Post
Office is vividly set forth by the old Secretary, Sir Francis Freeling.
"Cheap postage"&mdash;he writes, "What is this men are talking
about? Can it be that all my life I have been in error? If I, then
others&mdash;others whose behests I have been bound to obey. To
make the Post Office revenue as productive as possible was long
ago impressed upon me by successive ministers as a duty which I
was under a solemn obligation to discharge. And not only long ago.
Is it not within the last six months that the present Chancellor of
the Exchequer<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> has charged me not to let the present revenue go
down? What! You, Freeling, brought up and educated as you have
been, are you going to lend yourself to these extravagant schemes?
You with your four-horse mail coaches too! Where else in the
world does the merchant or the manufacturer have the materials
of his trade carried for him gratuitously or at so low a rate as to
leave no margin of profit?"<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center"><b>THE POSTAL ESTABLISHMENT AN INSTRUMENT OF POPULAR
COMMUNICATION</b></p>


<p>With the inauguration of inland penny postage the Postal Establishment
ceased to exist primarily as a tax-collecting agency,
and, although maintained as a whole upon a paying basis, certain
of its recent experiments have, from a financial point of view, been
far from successful. On the other hand, the simultaneous unification
and reduction of rates, together with various other changes
which have been adopted since 1840, have resulted in lessening
appreciably the expenses of management.</p>

<p>The postage on inland letters was reduced in 1865, 1871, 1884,
and again in 1897. In 1839, the last year of high postal rates, the
total number of letters, including franks, delivered in the United
Kingdom, was somewhat in excess of eighty-two millions. This number
was rather more than doubled in the following year. During
the ensuing ten years the figures were again doubled, the total in
1850 being 347 millions. For the five-year period 1866-70, following
the reduction in postage of 1865, the average yearly number
delivered was 800 millions. In 1875 this increased to a little over
1000 millions; in the postal year 1880-81 to 1176 millions, in 1890-91
to 1705 millions, and in 1900-01 to 2323 millions.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> So far as
colonial letters were concerned, a marked reduction in rates was
granted soon after inland penny postage was obtained, the reduction
being extended to the larger part of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Further
reductions followed until, in 1898, a penny half ounce rate was
established for most of the colonies, and all were included in 1905.
As on a previous occasion, the United States was the first foreign
country with which an agreement was made to adopt this low rate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64">[64]</a></span>and its advantages have been enhanced still further by an increase
in the initial weight from half an ounce to an ounce. During the sixties,
treaties were entered into with the most important European
countries for lower postage rates, and, in 1874, at the first meeting of
the Postal Union, a uniform rate for prepaid letters of 2&#189;<i>d.</i> a half
ounce was agreed to. Reductions also followed for other postal
matter. In 1891 a universal foreign letter rate of 2&#189;<i>d.</i> was announced
so far as the United Kingdom was concerned, with the
exception of those countries where a lower rate already prevailed,
and a further reduction followed in 1907 by increasing the initial
weight from half an ounce to an ounce in the case of all foreign and
colonial letters, the charge on foreign letters for each unit after the
first being reduced at the same time from 2&#189;<i>d.</i> to 1&#189;<i>d.</i></p>

<p>After 1840 the registration fee was reduced by a series of gradations
from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>d.</i>, and the compulsory registration of all letters
containing coin was enforced. In 1891 the separate system of insurance
was abolished, and registration was extended for the first
time to inland parcels. The limit of compensation was increased at
the same time to £25 and in the following year to £50 by the payment
of 2<i>d.</i> for the first £5 and an additional penny for each additional
£5 of insurance.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Seven years later the amount of compensation
payable was increased to £120 and the fee payable was lowered
for all sums over £15. Arrangements were also made by which
letters addressed to certain colonies and foreign countries might
be insured to the same maximum amount.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The limit of compensation
is now £400 for inland registered correspondence as well as for
correspondence to many foreign countries and a few of the colonies.</p>

<p>Among other postal reforms dear to Hill's heart had been the
compulsory payment of postage by means of stamps. He pointed
out that this would greatly simplify the keeping of accounts by the
department and increase the net revenue. The proposition was,
however, too unpopular to secure approval. Nevertheless in 1847
the Postmaster-General secured parliamentary authority to abolish
or restrict payment in money and require stamps to be
used, but the experiment proved so unpopular that it was eventually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65">[65]</a></span>abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The use of perforated stamps, an invention of
Mr. Archer, was in 1852 recommended by a committee appointed
to report on the question.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Finally, in 1904, the law forbidding the
use of embossed or impressed stamps cut out of envelopes, postcards,
letter cards, wrappers, and telegraph forms was repealed.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>From 1808 to 1840 the rural districts as a rule obtained their
postal matter by a special payment on their part to messengers for
its conveyance from the nearest town, sometimes aided by a bonus
from the revenue, or by means of the "fifth-clause" posts,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> or by
the penny posts which were constantly increasing in number and
were occasionally established under guarantee. In 1838 there were
fifty-two "fifth-clause" posts in England and Wales, and 1922 villages
in the United Kingdom were served by penny posts. In 1843
the government of Sir Robert Peel laid down the following principle:
"All places the letters for which exceed one hundred per
week should be entitled to a receiving office and a free delivery of
letters." A "delivery" here meant a daily delivery, and the boundary
of the free delivery was to be determined by the Postmaster-General.
The principle enunciated above was followed until 1850,
and during that period the increase in the number of free and guaranteed
rural deliveries was very great. At the close of this period
it was decided that in future the determining rule should be based
upon the probability of financial success. A post was held to pay
its way whenever its cost was covered by a halfpenny on each letter
delivered, but, since it was held that the number of letters
would be doubled by free delivery, double the number arriving
before its establishment might be assumed to arrive afterward.
The post might be bi-weekly, tri-weekly, or weekly. This rule
was to a certain extent made retroactive, but no post established
under the rule of 1843 was stopped so long as the cost was covered
by calculating delivered letters at a penny each. It was decided in
1853 that a post less frequent than once a day might be increased
in frequency whenever the cost would be covered by a revenue estimated
<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>on the basis of three farthings for each letter, and in treating
an application for a second daily post this amount was to be reduced
to one farthing. The experiment was tried of delivering letters at
every house in a few selected places but did not prove a success. It
was stated that at the end of this revision, 93 per cent of all postal
packets were delivered. In 1860 the rule was laid down that new
posts should be set up only when the cost would be covered by
half a penny on each letter actually arriving, the old rule having
been found to be too liberal. Two years later it was stated by
the Post Office that only 6 per cent of the total postal packages
were undelivered. In 1882 the question of extending the rural
posts was considered by Mr. Fawcett, the then Postmaster-General,
who decided that credit should be given for revenue by increasing
the halfpenny to 6/10<i>d.</i> for each letter, and in the next year the
existing rule as to a second daily delivery was made more liberal.
In 1890, for places hitherto unserved, the rate per letter for estimating
revenue was increased to three farthings, for each parcel the
rate was fixed at 1&#189;<i>d.</i>, and in the following year rural sanitary authorities
in England and Wales were authorized to guarantee posts.
In Scotland the district committee or the county council, where the
counties were not divided, was given the same power in 1892. In
the same year the rule was laid down that a second service in the
day might be given provided that its cost did not exceed half a
penny a letter and a penny a parcel and in addition that the total
cost of night and day mail services should not exceed the revenue
from the whole correspondence at half a penny per letter and a
penny per parcel. It was estimated in 1892 that about thirty-two
and a half millions of letters were undelivered, but the work of
extending the rural posts went on gradually until in 1897 it was
announced that provision would be made as soon as possible for
delivery to every house in the United Kingdom. In 1900 the Postmaster-General
was able to report that house to house delivery had
been completed in England and almost completed in Scotland and
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the ordinary delivery at regular intervals there
was a growing demand for a more rapid service on extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67">[67]</a></span>occasions as well as a desire for a special messenger service when
the use of the Post Office as a medium meant an undesirable loss
of time. In 1886 a private company started to supply messengers
for postal services. After some trouble with the Post Office, a
licence was granted them in 1891 in return for which they agreed
to pay a percentage of their gross receipts to the department and
observe certain conditions with reference to the delivery of letters.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
An express delivery service was also established by the Post
Office, the fee in addition to the ordinary postage being 2<i>d.</i> for the
first mile, 3<i>d.</i> for the second and beyond that, and where no public
conveyances existed, 1<i>s.</i> a mile or actual cab-fare. In the case of
letters delivered locally the ordinary postage was abrogated soon
after and a charge of 1&#189;<i>d.</i> per pound for parcels exceeding one
pound in weight was imposed, but this charge was later lowered to
a penny per pound with a maximum payment of 1<i>s.</i> and the maximum
limit of weight was increased from 15 to 20 pounds where the
messenger could travel by public conveyance. The initial charge
for the first mile of 2<i>d.</i>, and 3<i>d.</i> for each succeeding mile, for each
parcel was made a uniform charge of 3<i>d.</i> per mile, and the fixed
charge of 2<i>d.</i> for each parcel beyond the first was reduced to a
penny where several packets were tendered by the same sender for
delivery by the same messenger. In the case of several packages
delivered at the same address the charge was lowered to 3<i>d.</i> plus
an additional penny for every ten packages or part thereof, later
changed to a weight fee of 3<i>d.</i> on each packet or bundle of packets
weighing more than one pound.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Rural postmen were also allowed
to receive letters and parcels from the public at any point in their
walks and deliver them without passing them through a post office,
having first canceled the stamps.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> An agreement was also made
with the railways to carry single letters left in the booking office for
2<i>d.</i> each. These letters may be taken to the booking office by messenger
and delivered by a messenger at the end of their journey or
posted there.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The express delivery service was also extended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68">[68]</a></span>such foreign countries as would agree to it, including nearly all of
Western Europe, part of South America, and the far East. In every
case the primary fee in England is <i>3d.</i>, the foreign charges varying
with local conditions. Express letters from abroad are delivered
free within one mile from the Post Office. Beyond that the distance
charge is 3<i>d.</i> a mile for one parcel, with a penny for each additional
parcel delivered to the same person. The Postmaster-General
reported that the establishment of this service was not only much
appreciated by the people, but was self-supporting and even profitable
to the state. During the ten year period ending March 31, 1901,
the number of express delivery services in the United Kingdom
increased from 108,000 to 804,000.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The impressed stamp to which newspapers were subject until
1855 enabled them to pass free by post. After this stamp ceased to
be compulsory, newspapers which bore it passed free from other
postage until 1870&mdash;when the halfpenny rate was established&mdash;and
were known as "free"<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> as distinguished from "chargeable"
newspapers. Of the former there were carried by post in 1856 over
53 millions, of the latter, including book packets, 20 millions. In
1875 the number of newspapers delivered in the United Kingdom
had increased to 121 millions. For the five year period ending
March 31, 1881, the average yearly number had increased to a
little over 129 millions, for the next five years to something over
142 millions. During the period ending March 31, 1891, they had
increased to 155 millions, there being an actual decrease in one
year. In the period following there was an average yearly increase
of only three millions and the ensuing five years ending March 31,
1901, showed a decrease of about one million.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The book post, instituted in 1848, had its rates reduced in 1855
and again in 1870 to a halfpenny for the initial two ounces and an
additional &#189;<i>d.</i> for each succeeding two ounces. In 1892 its scope
was greatly enlarged and the expression Halfpenny Post, which is
now its official name, better illustrates its cosmopolitan character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69">[69]</a></span>for it now includes all printed documents of a conventional, formal,
or impersonal character. From 1872 to 1875 the number of articles
carried by the Halfpenny or Book Post increased from 114 millions
to 158 millions. The yearly average during the next five years
was 204 millions; during the following five, 305 millions and for the
five year period ending March 31, 1891, they had increased to 418
millions. During the next five years there was a still greater average
increase to 596 millions and the average for the postal year ending
in March, 1901, was 732 millions.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The rates for the Inland
Pattern and Sample Post, established in 1863, were assimilated
with those of the Book Post in 1870. It was abolished or rather incorporated
with the Letter Post in the following year but was reëstablished
in 1887, the rates being a penny for the first four ounces
and &#189;<i>d.</i> for each succeeding two ounces, but, when the Jubilee
letter rates were published, it lost its <i>raison d'être</i> and was abolished
for inland purposes.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Post cards were introduced in 1870, being carried for &#189;<i>d.</i> each
prepaid, 2<i>d.</i> when payment was made on delivery.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> In addition
to the stamp a charge was made to cover the cost of the material
in the card itself. Somewhat later reply post cards were issued for
the inland service and arrangements were made for the use of international
reply post cards. In 1894, private post cards, to which
a halfpenny stamp was affixed, were allowed to pass by post. The
resulting enormous growth<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> in their number showed that the privilege
was appreciated. In less than five years they were estimated
to form 5 per cent of the total number passing through the post.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Shortly after, the prohibition of any writing save the address on the
face of a post card was withdrawn and it was provided that the
address side of all mail matter might be used for purposes of correspondence
provided that it did not obscure the address, encroach
upon the stamp, or prove in any way inconvenient. Formerly, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70">[70]</a></span>far as mail matter other than post cards was concerned, the right
half of the face side was reserved for the address.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> During the four
five-year periods from 1881 to the year ending 31st March, 1901,
the average numbers of post cards delivered yearly in the United
Kingdom were about 108 millions, 152 millions, 272 millions, and
379 millions.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>It had not been usual for England to lag behind the continent in
the adoption of new postal ideas. Such was the case, however, with
reference to the adoption of the convenient post card and the no less
useful parcel post. In 1880 the question of the establishment of an
international parcel post was discussed in Paris and an agreement
was reached for the transmission throughout nearly the whole of
Europe of parcels not exceeding three kilogrammes in weight. It
was impossible for Great Britain to sign, as she had no inland parcel
post at the time and found it difficult to establish one as an agreement
with the railways was necessary. A movement was at once
begun for one and it was started three years later. The first despatch
of foreign and colonial parcels took place in 1885, and at the
beginning of the following year arrangements were completed for
the exchange of parcels with twenty-seven different countries, including
some of the colonies, India, and Egypt. An agreement was
concluded in 1904 with the United States for the interchange of
parcels by post at the rate of 2<i>s.</i> for each and the maximum is two
kilogrammes. These cannot be insured and customs' duties must
be paid by the recipient. The previously existing agreement for
parcels weighing as much as eleven pounds each, providing for
insurance and the prepayment of customs' duties, continues to be
carried on by the American Express Company.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Since the establishment
of the inland parcel post the question of collecting the
value of the parcels on delivery, if the sender and the recipient so
desire, has often been raised. Owing to the opposition of retail
dealers, it has not yet been adopted although in operation in India
and nearly all important foreign countries. In the words of the
Postmaster-General&mdash;"In these circumstances I am by no means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71">[71]</a></span>satisfied, so far as my enquiries have gone, that the apprehensions
expressed by retail traders in this country afford sufficient cause for
withholding a convenience from the community at large."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>The various changes and improvements adopted by the Post
Office since 1840, in addition to those already named, are so numerous
that only the most important can be considered here. Among
others the amalgamation of the London District Post with the
General Post in 1854 deserves attention. In the following year it
was ordered that letters should be sorted in each of the ten postal
districts into which London was divided instead of being taken to
the General Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand as had been customary,
thus materially lessening the expenses of sorting and facilitating
their delivery.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>In 1840 there were but 4028 post offices in the Kingdom; in 1854,
9973.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Road letter boxes were introduced in 1858 and the public
receptacles for the receipt of letters numbered 13,370 in 1859 as compared
with 4518 before the establishment of penny postage.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> In
1829 the total number of persons in England employed in Post
Office business numbered only 5000. Twenty-five years later for
the United Kingdom over 21,000 were so employed; in 1880 over
47,000, of whom, however, more than 11,000 were engaged wholly
in telegraph duties. By 1890 these had increased to nearly 118,000
and by 1900 to 173,000 of whom 35,000 were females.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>The money order business which originated as a private speculation
in 1791 was the result of an attempt to check the frequent
theft of letters containing money. In 1838, shortly after its acquisition
from the proprietors, the rates were reduced and the number
of money orders transmitted increased from 188,000 in 1839 to
587,000 in 1840 and to 1,500,000 in 1842. From the latter date
until 1879 the increase both in the number and in the value of
money orders transmitted was steady, aided by the increase in 1862
from £5 to £10 of the maximum transmissible sum and by the reduction
in rates in 1871. The penny rate of that year for orders to
the value of ten shillings was a mistake, for the actual cost to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72">[72]</a></span>state of issuing and paying a money order was about 3<i>d.</i> In order
to meet this difficulty a simpler form of order was issued in 1881
with an initial rate as low as half a penny, the cost of which to the
Post Office was much less than that of the old kind of order. These
postal notes, as they were called, were issued for new denominations
in 1884 and 1905 and the rates on some of them were diminished.
The lowest rate for a money order was for a few months
fixed at 3<i>d.</i> but, as this aroused considerable opposition, the present
rate of 2<i>d.</i> was soon after substituted, and in 1903 the maximum
sum transmissible was increased to £40 with a few accompanying
changes in rates. In 1889 an opportunity was given in the case
of a few towns for sending telegraphic money orders and during
the ensuing three years the privileged area was greatly extended.
In 1897 the expenses were considerably reduced. In 1858 arrangements
were made for the exchange of money orders with Canada
and by 1862 similar agreements were decided upon with most of
the other colonies, but foreign countries were not included until
somewhat later and in 1880 colonial and foreign rates were harmonized.
Rates were reduced in 1883, 1896, and 1903, and in the last
year the inland £40 limit was agreed upon with most foreign countries
and some of the colonies.</p>

<p>Inland money orders which started to decrease in amount in 1878-79
steadily continued their downward course until 1891-92, when
there was a slight recovery for a few years, but since 1903-04 the
number has somewhat diminished. During the postal year ending
in March, 1907, the number of inland money orders transmitted was
nearly eleven millions as compared with nearly nineteen millions
for the year ending March, 1879. This decrease in numbers is
largely due to the lowering of the registration fee for letters, the
introduction of postal notes, and the use of other means for transmitting
small sums of money. The total value of inland money
orders also began to diminish in 1879, but began to recover in 1886,
and has since increased quite uniformly, being in 1907 nearly
£38,000,000 as compared with £29,000,000 in 1879.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The increase
in the number of postal notes has been enormous, although there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73">[73]</a></span>was an apparent falling off in the years 1903 and 1904 due to the
increased number of denominations offered for sale. For the first
complete postal year after their authorization the number issued
was nearly four and a half millions of the value of £2,000,000, and
for the postal year 1906-07 the number was 102,000,000 of the
value of nearly £41,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> On the other hand, while inland
money orders were decreasing in number, colonial and foreign
orders increased in general both in number and value.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>The establishment of Post Office savings banks is naturally
closely connected with the money order department since both of
these departures from a purely postal character were adopted at
about the same time, for much the same reasons, and were opposed
on the ground of their infringement upon the banking prerogative.
In 1859 the efforts of Mr. Sikes of Huddersfield to bring a Post
Office Savings Bank into being were supported by Mr. Gladstone,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Rowland Hill, the then Secretary
of the Post Office, and two years later it was established by
Parliamentary sanction.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The main features of the system were
that deposits could be withdrawn not later than ten days after
demand; that accounts should be kept at London alone, all money
being remitted to and from headquarters; that the total amount
deposited should be handed over to the "Commissioners for the Reduction
of the National Debt" for investment in government securities,
and that interest on complete pounds at the rate of 2&#189; per
cent should be allowed to depositors. As the interests of the poorer
classes were made the primary object in establishing the banks,
deposits were limited in the case of individuals to £30 a year and
£150 in all, later increased to £50 a year and £200 in all, but
Friendly Societies were allowed to deposit without limit and Provident
and Charitable Societies might deposit within limits of £100
a year and £300 in all or, with the consent of the Commissioners,
beyond these limits.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>In 1880 the savings banks were made a medium for investing in
government stock at a trifling expense varying from 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74">[74]</a></span>and with the privilege of having dividends collected free from
further charge. These special advantages were confined to investments
from £10 to £100 in value, the latter being the maximum
sum in any one year, and the investments themselves might be
sums especially deposited or transferred from a depositor's account.
In 1887 the minimum amount of stock purchasable was
reduced to 1s., and anyone who had purchased stock through a
savings bank might have it transferred to his own name in the
Bank of England. In 1893 the limits of investment were raised
from £100 to £200 in one year, from £300 to £500 in all, and the
Post Office was empowered to invest in stock any accumulations
of ordinary deposits above the limit of £200, unless instructions
were given by the depositor to the contrary.</p>

<p>An act was passed in 1864 enabling the Postmaster-General to
insure the lives of individuals between the ages of fourteen and
sixty for amounts varying from £20 to £100. He might also grant
annuities, immediate or deferred, to any one of ten years of age or
upward for sums between £4 and £50. The act came into operation
in certain towns of England and Wales in the following year,
and the system remained unaltered until 1884. During this period
of nineteen years, 7064 policies of insurance were effected, representing
a yearly average of 372 policies amounting to an average
of £79 each. The contracts for immediate annuities numbered
13,402 or an average of 705 a year and there were 978 contracts for
deferred annuities. The value of immediate annuities granted was
£187,117 and of deferred £19,938, but a part of the latter never
came into payment as the purchasers were relieved from their bargains
upon their own representation.</p>

<p>A new system associated with Mr. Fawcett's name was prescribed
in 1882. Its merit consisted in linking the annuity and insurance
business with the Savings Bank Department so that payments
for annuities and insurance are made through deposits in the
savings banks. It was further provided that for persons between the
ages of fourteen and sixty-five the limits of insurance should be
from £5 to £100 and that sums of money might be insured payable
at the age of sixty or at the expiration of a term of years. For annuities
the minimum was reduced to £1, the maximum increased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75">[75]</a></span>
£100, and the annuity and insurance privileges were extended to all
places having savings banks. Owing to the necessary preparation
of tables the new regulations did not actually come into operation
until 1884. The growth of life insurance and annuity business was
slow as compared with the rapid growth of the savings deposits.
Intended, however, primarily for the poor, it has not been without
success, especially as the premiums charged are lower than those
of insurance companies or industrial societies.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>In addition to joining the insurance and annuity business with the
savings banks operations, Mr. Fawcett was responsible for a rapid
increase in the number of branch saving offices in villages, for the
special attention paid to "navvies" and workmen at their places
of employment, and above all for the arrangement for making small
deposits by slips of postage stamps. In 1887 by act of Parliament
the Postmaster-General was empowered to offer facilities for the
transfer of money from one account to another and for the easier
disposal of the funds of deceased depositors. In 1891 the maximum
permissible deposits of one person were increased from £150 to £200
inclusive of interest. The annual limit remained at £30 but it was
provided that, irrespective of that limit, depositors might replace
the amount of any one withdrawal made in the same year. Where
principal and interest together exceeded £200, the interest was
henceforth to cease on the excess alone, whereas previously it had
ceased entirely when it had brought an account to £200. The next
development arose from the Free Education Act of 1891 in order to
make it easier for children and parents to save the school pence
which they no longer had to pay. Special stamp slips were prepared
to be sold to children, and clerks attended the schools with
these slips. About 1400 schools adopted the scheme at once and
three years later the number had risen to 3000, but the movement
seemed by 1895 to have spent its force.</p>

<p>In 1893 the annual limit of deposits was increased to £50 and,
as we have already seen in another connection, any accumulations
over £200 were to be invested in Government Stock unless the depositor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76">[76]</a></span>gave instructions to the contrary. In the same year arrangements
were made for the withdrawal of deposits by telegram.
A depositor might telegraph for his money and have his warrant
sent by return of post at a cost of about 9<i>d.</i> or the warrant also
might be telegraphed to him at a total cost of about 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> In 1905
a rule was introduced by which a depositor, on presentation of his
pass-book at any post office doing savings bank business, may withdraw
on demand not more than £1. This obviates the expense of
telegraphing and, that it was appreciated, is shown by the fact
that during the first six months after the privilege was extended
there were nearly two millions of "withdrawals on demand," forming
nearly one half of the total number. As a result the number
of telegraphic withdrawals fell from 227,573 for the postal year
1904-05 to 180,996 for the year 1905-06.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>There has been a steady and pronounced growth in savings bank
business since its establishment. This growth has shown itself in
the increased number of banks, of deposits, and of the total amounts
deposited. The average amount of each deposit has varied somewhat
from £3 6<i>s.</i> in 1862 to £2 in 1881, but since this date it has
increased slowly but steadily and in 1901 it stood at £2 14<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>,
which is about the average yearly amount since 1862. At the end
of the year 1900 over £135,000,000 were on deposit in the Post
Office savings banks.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The increase in amounts invested in government
stock has not been by any means so pronounced but there
has been an increase. In 1881 we find that nearly £700,000 were so
invested, in 1891 nearly £1,000,000, and in 1900 a little over
£1,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> So far as annuities are concerned, the immediate
seem to be considerably more popular than the deferred. The
purchase money receipts for the former were £184,000 in 1881,
£296,000 in 1891, and have since increased more rapidly to £728,000
in 1900, with an actual decrease, however, for the four preceding
years. The receipts for the purchase of deferred annuities
amounted to £5243 in 1881, £12,578 in 1891 and £14,283 in 1900,
also a decrease since 1896. The amounts received as premiums for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77">[77]</a></span>life insurance policies have also been rather disappointing, having
increased from £10,967 in 1881 to £15,073 in 1891 and to £22,185
in 1900.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>The increasing use of railway trains for the conveyance of the
mails has presented new and difficult problems with reference to
the authority of the Postmaster-General over mail trains and reasonable
payments to the railway companies. So far as the method
for ascertaining the rate of payment was concerned, a difficulty
arose as to whether the Post Office should pay any part of the tolls
as distinguished from operating expenses. Major Harness, a Post
Office official, stated that in discussing this question with Robert
Stephenson in the case of the London and Birmingham Railway it
had been agreed that tollage should not be paid but only the out-of-pocket
expenses, this being in conformity with the principles
adopted in paying for mail coaches. The question of tollage was
not mentioned by the Railway Mails Act (10 and 11 Vict., c. 85),
but Major Harness, in his evidence before a parliamentary committee,
stated that he, as an arbitrator, estimated the tollage payable
by the Post Office by finding out how much each ton, if the
road were fully occupied, should contribute to return 10 per cent
upon the share capital and 5 per cent on the bonds, the Post Office
to pay its proportion according to the weight of mail matter carried.
The cost of locomotive power was also taken into count and
the carriage accommodation was paid for on the basis of what the
railways charged each other.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> In addition to these items the committee
recommended that the expenses for station accommodation,
the additional cost of the working staff, and interference with ordinary
traffic should also be taken into account.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> In the event of a
failure on the part of the Post Office and a railway company to come
to an agreement as to the amount payable, each of the parties nominated
an arbitrator whose first duty was to select an umpire. Each
arbitrator was required to present his case in writing to the umpire
and to attend in person if required. The umpire was supposed to
give his decision within twenty-eight days after the receipt of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78">[78]</a></span>cases.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> In 1893 it was provided by act of Parliament that when
any dispute arose between the Post Office and a railway, the question
should be taken to the Railway and Canal Commission for
settlement instead of being left to arbitration.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The Postmaster-General
has also been authorized to make use of tramways for
transporting the mails, and in 1897 the experiment was made of
using motor vans for the same purpose. A few years later the
Postmaster-General expressed himself as "doubtful whether a
thoroughly reliable motor vehicle suitable for Post Office work has
yet been found." However, in 1906-07 about thirty-five mail
services were performed by motors, the work being undertaken by
contractors who provide the vans and employ the drivers. They
have proved to be more economical than horse vans when the load
is heavy, the distance considerable, and greater speed desirable.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The expenditure for the conveyance of mails by the railways for
the year ending 5th January, 1838, amounted to only £1743. In
1840 this had increased to £52,860, in 1850 to £230,079, in 1860 to
£490,223, in 1870 to £587,296, in 1880 to £701,070 and in 1890 to
£905,968. By 1896 the million mark had been reached and after
that year all the expenses for the conveyance of the mails are
grouped together. For the following year this total was £1,453,517,
the payment for mail coaches in the preceding year, which are here
included, being £365,000. In 1906 the total expenditure for the
"conveyance of the mails" was £1,821,541.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>In common with the members of other branches of the civil service
the postal employees, prior to 1855, were political appointees.
The appointment of a patronage secretary had relieved members of
Parliament from the odium incurred as a result of this reprehensible
method of manning the service, but it is doubtful whether any
improvement in the personnel of the force actually resulted or was
even anticipated. With the adoption between 1855 and 1870 of the
principle that fitness should be tested by competitive examinations,
the vast majority of the members of the postal establishment came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79">[79]</a></span>under its influence. At the same time the postmasters of small
rural communities, where the postal revenue was insignificant,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
still continued to be nominated by the local member. In 1896 this
power was abridged, but members still continued to exercise a limited
right of recommendation. Finally in 1907 the Postmaster-General
announced that, though due weight should continue to be
given to the opinions of members in the case of the appointment of
these rural postmasters, such recommendations should be based on
personal knowledge and should carry no more weight than the
opinion of any other competent person.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>No question which has arisen in the internal management of the
Post Office has presented more difficult problems for solution than
that of the condition of the postal employees with reference to hours
of labour, promotion, and remuneration. The first complaints
which attract our attention during the period under discussion
came rather from outside the service as a protest against Sunday
labour in the Post Office, but the fact that many of the postal servants
were deprived of their holiday and often needlessly so deprived
was a real grievance advanced by the employees themselves.
It had been the policy of the Post Office for some time not to grant
any application for the withdrawal of a Sunday post if there were
any dissentients to the application. In 1850 all Sunday delivery
was abolished for a time, but this hardly met the approval even of
the strict Sabbatarians, and the rule was promulgated the same
year that no post should be withdrawn or curtailed except upon
the application of the receivers of six sevenths of the letters so
affected. Of the rural posts in the United Kingdom at that time
more than half did no work on Sunday and about half of the remainder
had their walks curtailed, while in certain cases a substitute
was provided on alternate Sundays. A committee reporting on
the question in 1871 advised that it should be made easier to discontinue
a Sunday delivery by requiring that a Sunday rural post
should be taken off if the receivers of two thirds of the letters desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80">[80]</a></span>it,
that no delivery in the country should be granted except
upon the demand of the receivers of the same proportion of letters,
and that the principle of providing substitutes on alternate Sundays
should be more generally adopted. This report was favourably
received and its recommendations adopted in the early
seventies. In London and many of the provincial towns there is no
ordinary Sunday delivery, and so little advantage is taken of the
opportunity for express delivery on Sundays that there is presumably
no strong demand for a regular Sunday delivery. Various
measures advocated for the relief of the town carriers were also
adopted.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>In 1858 an attempt was made by the Post Office employees, led
by the letter carriers, to secure higher wages and to obtain a remedy
for certain other grievances advanced by them. Sir George Bower
asked for a select committee of enquiry in their behalf but this was
refused by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He agreed, however,
to the appointment of a committee composed of Post Office and
Treasury officials, but their personnel was so repugnant to the employees
that they refused to give evidence, and as a result of this
and other difficulties four of their leaders were suspended. The
protest on the part of the men was not entirely unproductive, for in
the end the Postmaster-General granted them a slight increase in
their wages. At the same time he referred to the following rates of
wages in support of his contention that there was no good ground
for dissatisfaction among the servants of the Post Office: for
carriers, 19<i>s.</i> a week advancing to 23<i>s.</i>; for sorters of the first class,
25<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i>; of the second class, 32<i>s.</i> to 38<i>s.</i>; and of the third class,
40<i>s.</i> to 50<i>s.</i> "Carriers also obtain Christmas boxes averaging, so it
is said, £8 a year. In addition these wages are exclusive of uniform,
of pension in old age, and of assistance for assurance."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>The first thorough-going attempts to remedy the grievances of
the Post Office employees were made in 1881 and 1882 by Mr.
Fawcett in his capacity as Postmaster-General. His scheme for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81">[81]</a></span>improving the pay and position of the sorters, sorting clerks, telegraphists,
postmen, lobby officers, and porters resulted in a mean
annual cost to the Post Office of £320,000. In 1888, 1890, and 1891,
under the supervision of Mr. Raikes, improvements were made in
the condition of the chief clerks and other supervising officers, the
sorting clerks and telegraphists in the provinces, the telegraphists,
counter-men and sorters in London, and the sorters in Dublin and
Edinburgh at an additional yearly expense of £281,000. While the
representatives of the London postmen were in process of examination,
some of them went out on strike. They were severely punished,
some 450 men being dismissed in one morning, and a committee
was appointed to enquire into the complaints of the London
and provincial postmen.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> In the same month that the strike took
place Mr. Raikes announced increases in the pay of the postmen
involving an additional yearly payment of £125,000. The revisions
so announced from 1881 to 1894 have been estimated to
involve an increased annual expenditure of nearly £748,000.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>A committee was appointed in 1895 to deal with the discontent
which was only lessened, not silenced, by the efforts of Messrs.
Fawcett and Raikes. This was composed of Lord Tweedmouth, Sir
F. Mowatt, Mr. Spencer Walpole, and Mr. Llewellyn Smith, and
the compromise which they proposed was known as the "Tweedmouth
Settlement" which apparently gave little satisfaction at the
time and less thereafter. It resulted in a higher average rate of
payment, but dissatisfaction was felt because the pay for some
services was less than before. The basis of the report was "the abolition
of classification whereby each man was allowed to proceed by
annual increments to the maximum pay of a combined class, subject
only to an efficiency-bar which he may not pass without a certificate
of good conduct and ability, together with the abolition of
allowances for special services." Differences in pay according to the
volume of business in particular localities were left untouched, and
this was the cause of much complaint. Special inducements in the
shape of double increments were offered to the staff on the postal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82">[82]</a></span>and telegraph sides to learn each other's work in order to lighten
the strain which might otherwise fall on a particular branch. Overtime,
Sunday and bank-holiday pay were assimilated throughout
the service, and efforts were made to reduce the hardship resulting
from "split" work, so called from the fact that the working day
of many of the men was divided by an interval when there was
nothing to do. The higher officials were acquitted of favouritism
in the matter of promotion and of "unfairness and undue severity
in awarding punishments and in enforcing discipline." The general
charges of overcrowding the post offices and leaving them in
an unsanitary condition were also rejected. The changes proposed
were all adopted at an immediate estimated cost of £139,000 a
year and an ultimate cost, also estimated, of £275,000.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The
Tweedmouth Commission in its turn was soon followed by a departmental
committee, composed of the Duke of Norfolk, then
Postmaster-General, and Mr. Hanbury, the Secretary of the Treasury,
then acting as the representative of the Post Office in the
House of Commons. The postal employees demanded that their
grievances should be laid before a select committee composed of
members of the House of Commons, and motions to that effect
were introduced year after year only to meet the Government's
disapproval. The most important demands of the men turned
upon the questions of full civil rights, complete recognition of
their unions, the employment of men who were not members of
the civil service, and the old difficulty of wages and hours. So
far as the question of full civil rights was concerned, the Post Office
employees had been granted the franchise in 1874, but were required
not to take an active part in aiding or opposing candidates
for election, by serving on committees or otherwise making themselves
unduly conspicuous in elections. The men demanded that
these restrictions should be withdrawn. In the second place, the
Postmaster-General refused to receive deputations from those employees
not directly interested in the question at stake, refused to
recognize officials who were not also employees of the Department,
and exercised more or less control over the meetings of employees.
Finally, in addition to the general demand for higher wages due to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83">[83]</a></span>the higher cost of living, the telegraphists contended that they had
been deceived by the promise of a maximum salary of £190 a year,
whereas they actually received only £160. Mr. A. Chamberlain
opposed the appointment of a select committee of members of the
House of Commons because of the pressure likely to be brought
upon them and because of their unfitness to decide upon the question
at issue. He agreed, however, after consultation with various
members of Parliament and the men themselves, that a committee of
enquiry might reasonably be granted, composed of business men not
in the Civil Service and not members of the House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>In accordance with this promise the so-called "Bradford Committee"
was appointed to report on "the scales of pay received
by the undermentioned classes of established civil servants and
whether, having regard to the conditions of their employment and
to the rates current in other occupations, ... the remuneration
is adequate." In the meantime Mr. Chamberlain retired, but his
successor, Lord Stanley, asked that the enquiry be continued. The
members of this committee, interpreting their instructions very
loosely, extended their report to include their own recommendations
as to changes in pay, and refrained entirely from making any
comparison between the wages of postal servants and those in
other employments, on the ground that such information was easily
accessible from the statistics published by the Board of Trade.
They added that it was difficult to make any comparison between
a national and a private service, for payment according to results
and dismissal at the will of the employer are inapplicable under the
state. There was also a pension fund in the service, the present
value of which it is difficult to estimate. In their own words, "It
appears to us that the adequacy of the terms now obtaining may
be tested by the numbers and character of those who offer, by the
capacity they show on trial, and finally by their contentment."
They agreed that there was no lack of suitable candidates and
no complaints as to capacity, but there was widespread discontent.
Finally the committee recommended the grading of the service as a
whole, taking into consideration the differences in cost of living as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84">[84]</a></span>between London and other cities and between these cities and
smaller towns and an increase in pay of the man at an age to marry,
irrespective of years of service. "They" (the above recommendations)
"obviously do not concede all that has been asked for, but
they go as far as we think justifiable in meeting the demands of the
staff and we trust it will do much to promote that contentment
which is so essential to hearty service."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> From an examination of
the evidence presented by the Committee and a comparison of
present scales of pay in the Post Office with those current in other
employments, the Postmaster-General concluded that there was
no reason for increasing the maximum wages payable, but there
seemed to be ground for modifying and improving the scales in
some respects. The special increase at the age of twenty-five was
granted. The maximum was increased in London and the larger
towns on account of the higher cost of living and at the same time
wages in the smaller towns were advanced. The postmen also, both
in London and the provinces, were granted higher wages, and all
payments to the members of the force were in the future to be
made weekly. The additional cost entailed by these changes was
estimated at £224,400 for 1905-06, the average in later years at
£372,300.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The Post Office employees who had asked for the appointment
of a select committee were greatly dissatisfied with the personnel
of the "Bradford Committee." This dissatisfaction on their
part was increased by the fact that the recommendations of the
committee were to a great extent disregarded by Lord Stanley
on the ground that the members had not reported upon the question
laid before them, but had instead proposed a complete reorganization
of the whole of the service. He was willing to grant
some increase in pay but there were certain recommendations of
the committee which he refused to accept. He himself was of the
opinion that the average wages of the employees were in excess of
those of men doing similar work under competitive conditions, but
the postmen objected to a comparison of their wages with those of
employees in the open labour market on the ground "that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85">[85]</a></span>is no other employer who fixes his own prices or makes an annual
profit of £4,000,000 sterling." Delegates representing over 42,000
members of various postal associations protested strongly against
Lord Stanley's refusal to adopt the findings of the "Bradford Committee"
<i>in toto</i> and the men prepared to take an active part against
the Government in the approaching election. Appeals were sent
out by the men from which Lord Stanley quoted as follows in the
House: "Two thirds at least of one political party are in great
fear of losing their seats. The swing of the pendulum is against
them and any member who receives forty or fifty of such letters
will under present circumstances have to consider very seriously
whether on this question he can afford to go into the wrong lobby.
This is taking advantage of the political situation."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The Postmaster-General's
unpopularity with his employees was not diminished
by his reference to these appeals as "nothing more or less
than blackmail." He himself was of the opinion that there should
be some organization outside of politics to which such questions
should be referred.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the Liberals had come into power, a Post Office
circular was issued granting to the secretaries of the branches of
the various postal organizations the right to make representations
to the Postmaster-General relating to the service and affecting the
class of which the branch of an association was representative. In
matters solely affecting an individual the appeal had to come from
the individual himself. This was followed by a full recognition of
the postal unions by the new Postmaster-General, Mr. Buxton, with
the rights of combination and representation through the representatives
of different classes. These conclusions were commented
upon most favourably at the annual meeting of the "Postmen's
Federation."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> The representatives present were glad to see that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86">[86]</a></span>"the old martinet system was fast breaking down." <a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> But the greatest
triumph of the men was to follow in the appointment of a select
committee composed of members of the House of Commons with
full powers to investigate the conditions of employment of the
postal employees and make such recommendations, based upon
their investigation, as might seem suitable. Nine members were appointed
for this purpose, two of their number being members of the
Labour Party, and Mr. Hobhouse was chosen as chairman. Their
report is very voluminous and treats minutely all the questions
concerning which the postal employees had expressed so much dissatisfaction.
The most important of these are connected with the
civil rights of the men, their wages, hours of labour, and the conditions
of their employment. The demand for full civil rights was
supported by four members on the ground that the position of the
postal employees is not in many respects "comparable to that of
the Civil Service as a whole," but the point was lost for the men by
the vote of the chairman. Some departments asked for a reduction
in the age of voluntary retirement from sixty to fifty and of compulsory
retirement from sixty-five to sixty, but these changes were
not recommended by the committee. The question of extending
part of their pensions to the widows and children of deceased employees
was referred to a plebiscite of the employees themselves.
So far as incapacitated officials were concerned, it was pointed out
that the "Workmen's Compensation Act" of 1906 had been extended
to them. Night work had been limited to the time from
10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, seven hours of night work counting as eight hours
of day work. The committee asked that night duty be from 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
to 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the ratio of the relative value to remain unchanged.
Some servants asked for a forty-two hour week, especially in the
case of those who had "split" work to do, and for a half holiday
each week. The committee thought that the forty-eight hour week
should remain unchanged but that a half holiday might be granted
where "the exigencies of the service demand." They also recommended
that compensation should be allowed where free medical
attendance was not granted. There was a general protest from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87">[87]</a></span>postmen, telegraphists, and sorters against the employment of
casual and auxiliary labour on the ground that it dealt a blow at
thorough work and trade unionism. The Department replied that
it was necessary in the case of especially busy holiday periods and
where "split" attendance was unavoidable. The committee contented
themselves by asking that casuals who have full work elsewhere
should not be employed. The claim on the part of the employees
that promotion should be contingent on "seniority, good
conduct and ability," in the order named was not accepted by the
committee, whose members contended that ability, as at present,
should count for most. So far as wages themselves were concerned,
a general increase was approved by the committee, and it also,
commenting unfavourably on the complexity and number of existing
classes, recommended a reduction in their number and greater
regularity and simplicity in grading them. <a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>The recommendations of the "Hobhouse Committee" have
proved, in many respects, unsatisfactory to the postal employees
who have not hesitated to express their condemnation of what they
consider the sins both of commission and omission of the members.
In the words of the delegates from the branches of the "Postmen's
Federation" meeting in London: "We express our deep disappointment
with the report of the Select Committee for the following
reasons": the "cowardice" of the committee in recommending
the continuance of the system of Christmas boxes; the failure
in many cases to increase the minimum and maximum rates of
wages; the mistaken method of grading towns for wages; the failure
to grant full civil rights and the granting of so much power to
the permanent officials. The Conference of Postal Clerks in turn
expressed their dissatisfaction with the findings of the committee.
The "Irish Postal and Telegraph Guardian" considered that the
"report had intensified discontent" and commented on the fact
that large increases in salaries to highly paid classes had been recommended
without any agitation on their part while the lower
grades got practically nothing, this in direct opposition to opinions
expressed both by Mr. Buxton and Mr. Ward, a member of the
committee. Deputations were appointed to discuss with the Postmaster-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88">[88]</a></span>those findings of the committee which were unsatisfactory,
but Mr. Buxton refused to grant a re-trial of the controverted
points although he agreed to listen to the plea of those
employees whose case had not been presented before the committee. <a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Buxton explained his position with reference to the recommendations
of the committee in a speech delivered in the House.
He knew that in the case of the Tweedmouth and Bradford committees
the men stated beforehand that they would not be bound
by the decisions reached, but on the other hand had asked for
a Parliamentary committee as the only solution of the difficulty.
Broadly speaking, he was of the opinion that the findings of the
committee should be binding, and he understood that the men
would agree to accept them. There were, however, certain points
of the report on which nearly every section of the staff asked for a
re-trial, but this he was compelled to refuse. The most important
recommendations of the committee which were adopted by Mr.
Buxton are: an increase in the case of each employee to the minimum

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center"><b>THE TRAVELLERS' POST AND POST HORSES</b></p>


<p>The duty of providing horses for conveying letters and for the
use of travellers on affairs of state was enforced from the beginning
of the sixteenth century by orders and warrants issued by the
Postmaster-General and the Privy Council to mayors, sheriffs, constables,
and other officials.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Where ordinary posts were laid, the
postmen themselves were supposed to have horses ready. Such at
least was the understanding, not, however, invariably realized. In
1533 we find the Postmaster-General complaining that, except between
London and Dover, there were never any horses provided
over the whole kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> A few years later when the London-Berwick
posts became an established fact each postman had to
provide one horse, always to be ready to carry either the mails or a
chance traveller on affairs of state. In 1542, since, owing to trouble
with Scotland, the number of letters and travellers between that
country and London had become much more numerous, each postman
was required to have in readiness three horses instead of one,
and it was partly for this reason that their pay was increased at the
same time.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The fee for the use of these horses was fixed at a penny
a horse for every mile travelled. Generally this fee was named in
the warrant empowering the traveller to take up horses.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> When
the sum was not definitely named, it was required that it should be
reasonable.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> It seems to have been the custom of the members of
the Council to grant these warrants quite indiscriminately. To
remedy this, it was provided in 1566 that in future no warrant
should be granted to any person, who was not actually travelling
upon state affairs.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Twelve years later we find the people of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90">[90]</a></span>Grantham petitioning the Council against the taking-up of horses
to ride post. They said that the practice had increased so much
that it had become intolerable.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The demand for horses had become
so great that 2<i>d.</i> a mile was asked for each horse and complaint
was made that travellers and messengers refused to pay the
increased charge.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> It is improbable that the state was successful in
preventing the use of the postmasters' horses by private individuals,
and it is more improbable still that the postmasters themselves
objected to hiring their horses to those who travelled on their own
affairs. Warrants issued by the Council nearly always fixed the
price which should be paid. Now such prices, like wages when
fixed by employers, are likely to be lower than demand and supply
warrant. On the other hand, as between the postmasters and the
ordinary travellers, the question of charge was adjusted by agreement.</p>

<p>When the postmasters themselves were too poor to obtain horses
at their own expense, they were sometimes aided by the town or
county. In Norfolk, for instance, each one of three postmasters
was provided with a certain sum out of the treasury of the city of
Norwich to be lent without interest. They were also paid so much
a year out of money levied on the people of Norwich, one half on
the innkeepers and tipplers and one half on the other inhabitants.
No man was to take up post horses in Norwich unless licensed by
warrants from the Queen, the Council, the Duke of Norfolk, or
the Mayor of Norwich. No one was to ride a horse farther than
twelve or fourteen miles at a stretch, and he was to pay 2<i>d.</i> each
mile and 6<i>d.</i> to his guide to lead back the horses. No horse was to
carry any cloak bag over ten pounds in weight.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>If more horses were demanded from the postmaster than he himself
had in his stable, he might seize them from his neighbours but
the full amount paid was to go to the owners. The date of the commission
empowering horses to be used, the name of the person using
them, and the date when the horses were demanded were to be
entered in a book, kept for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Complaints from the postmasters concerning the abuses of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91">[91]</a></span>travellers were frequent. The London-Berwick posts in a petition
to the Council stated that on account of the great number riding
over that road many of their horses were injured or spoiled and were
not paid for, while the constables, whose duty it was to see that
horses were provided, were often ill-treated. Accordingly by a proclamation
issued in 1578, it was provided that no commission to
ride in post should be issued unless it was first moved at a council
meeting or ordered by the Secretary for causes properly relating to
Her Majesty's service.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> This was followed in 1582 by a still more
stringent proclamation, forbidding any person to use a commission
more than once unless otherwise specified. The pay of 2<i>d.</i> a mile
for each horse was to be in advance as was also the "guide's groat"
and, if the payment was not so advanced, the postmaster might
refuse to supply horses.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Occasionally we find people objecting to
having their horses taken when the postmaster had not sufficient
of his own. Complaints like these were generally followed by an
order to the offending postmaster to provide himself with more
horses.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>The travellers, however, were not the only people who were at
fault. The owners of the horses were often offenders and can hardly
be blamed for rendering as difficult as possible the enforcement of
the obnoxious proclamations, which they were ordered to obey. If
they had to supply horses, they must do so, but there was nothing
to prevent them from offering clumsy plough horses or venerable
specimens no longer capable of drawing a plough. The constables
were more apt to sympathize with the owners, who were their
neighbours, than with the travellers. Consequently it is not surprising
that complaints were loud and deep over the pieces of
horseflesh, whose angular outlines must have presented a sorry seat
for the Queen's messengers.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>By a Privy Council proclamation issued in 1603, all posts receiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92">[92]</a></span>a daily fee were required to keep at least two horses apiece. So
far as the letting of horses was concerned, they had up to this time
been subject to competition from other people, who had horses to
hire. They were now granted the prior right to provide horses for
travellers and it was only in case of their supply being inadequate
that horses might be procured elsewhere. The hire as usual was to
be paid in advance and was fixed at 2&#189;<i>d.</i> a mile, together with the
guide's fee for those riding on commission and was to be settled by
agreement for all others. No heavier burden than thirty pounds in
excess of the rider's weight was to be carried by each horse.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>It is in connection with the monopolistic restriction of 1603 that
Macaulay says that the state must have reaped a large reward from
the prior right of the postmasters to hire horses to travellers.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Mr.
Joyce has pointed out that the proceeds went to the postmasters
and not to the state, but he has given no good reason for dissenting
from Macaulay's opinion. Without doubt Joyce is correct, as is
shown by a complaint from the postmasters on the Western Road
that they had been injured by an interloper who supplied travellers
with horses.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> In 1779, the state made an attempt to obtain
something from the postmasters by requiring them to take out a
licence for the hiring of horses and to pay a percentage for their
receipts to the government.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Indirectly, however, the state did
reap some benefit from the revenue from post horses, for if the
postmasters had received nothing from their horses or from the
conveyance of private letters, it would have been necessary to pay
their salaries much more promptly than was the custom. As early
as the latter part of the sixteenth century, we find complaints from
the London-Dover posts that they had received nothing on their
salaries for a whole year.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> This was nothing to later complaints and
proves that an impecunious government was enabled to act the bad
debtor by the fact that other forms of revenue were available for
the postmasters.</p>

<p>In 1609 the rate for each horse was raised from 2&#189;<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> a mile,
and an attempt was made to enforce the postmasters' monopoly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93">[93]</a></span>more strictly.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> No horse was to be ridden beyond the initial stage
unless with the consent of the postmaster concerned. The postmasters
complained that they were held responsible for supplying
horses, and yet, when it was necessary to obtain them from the
surrounding country, they were resisted by the owners or were supplied
with inefficient animals.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The complaints of the public were
more to the purpose. According to them there were some who were
being called upon constantly for horses while others escaped all
demands. The postmasters often accepted bribes from owners of
horses on condition that they should not be troubled.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> At times
the horses, after being seized, were not used but were kept in the
stables of the postmasters, and their owners charged the expense of
maintaining them.</p>

<p>At the establishment of Witherings' plan in 1635, the postmasters
on all the roads in England were required to have as many
horses ready as were necessary for the carriage of letters and the
accommodation of travellers. The rate for each horse was lowered
from 3<i>d.</i> to 2&#189;<i>d.</i> or 5<i>d.</i> for two horses and a guide.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Before 1635,
the post enjoyed no priority over the traveller in being provided
with horses, and if all the horses happened to be in use when the
mail arrived, it had to wait. Now it was provided that on the day
when the mail was expected, enough horses should be kept in the
stable to ensure its prompt transmission.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> In 1637, after Witherings'
dismissal, the fee for the hire of a horse was raised again to 3<i>d.</i>
at which rate it continued until 1657, when it was lowered to 2&#189;<i>d.</i>
by the Commonwealth Government. So much trouble had been
caused by the seizure of horses from owners unwilling to part with
them that it was provided by the act of 1657 that no one might
take or seize horses for service without the consent of the owner,
but no one save the Postmaster-General and his deputies might
hire horses to persons riding in post with or without commission.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
At the Restoration in 1660, the old rate of 3<i>d.</i> a mile for each horse
was re-imposed together with a 4<i>d.</i> fee to the guide for each stage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94">[94]</a></span>If the postmaster was unable to furnish horses within half an hour,
they might be obtained elsewhere, but always with the consent of
the owner.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>The sole right to supply horses was continued to the Postmasters-General
and their deputies by the famous act of 1711. The rate per
horse and the guide's fee remained at the figure imposed by the act
of 1660. If the postmaster did not supply the horses demanded
within half an hour, he was liable to a fine of £5 and the horses
might be obtained from any one who would consent to hire them.
The maximum burden for one horse over and above the rider's
weight was eighty pounds.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>The postmasters enjoyed the monopoly of letting horses to
travellers until the middle of the eighteenth century. But the industrial
growth of England and the improvement in the roads had
produced such an increase in the number of travellers that the postmasters
were unable to supply the demand. The use of carriages
had become more common, enabling people to travel who could
not proceed on horseback, and this had still further increased the
demand for horses. It was plain that something must be done and
some more extensive source of supply drawn upon than that furnished
under the old system. The postmen had heard some of the
rumours in the air that a change was about to be made, and they
forwarded a petition to the House of Commons, protesting against
the contemplated change as an infringement upon their old monopoly.
They said "that if the amendment should pass into a law as
it is now drawn, it would not only tend to the great damage and
loss of the petitioners, but also the prejudice of His Majesty's revenue."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
The amendment did pass, however, declaring that in future
any one might furnish chaises and calashes with horses and that
people letting chaises might supply horses for them at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>In 1779, when the Treasury was sadly in need of money, an act
was passed, requiring all persons letting horses to take out licences.
In addition, duties were levied on all horses and carriages hired for
the purpose of travelling post.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> In the following year this act was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95">[95]</a></span>superseded by a stricter and more comprehensive one. It was provided
by the new act that every person letting horses to travel
should pay five shillings a year for a licence. In addition one penny
a mile should be paid for every horse, or, if the distance was not
known, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, such duties to be paid by the person hiring
the horses to the postmaster or other person who provided them, to
be by him handed over to the Treasury. At the time of payment
the postmaster was to give the traveller a ticket, which must be
shown to the toll keepers on the road. If he had no ticket to show,
the toll keeper was ordered not to allow him to pass.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Five years
later the duty to be collected was raised to 1&#189;<i>d.</i> a mile for each horse
or 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a day.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> In 1787, permission was given to let these duties
out to farm, because so many difficulties had been experienced in
their collection.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The whole theory of these duties was illogical, for
it was to every one's interest to evade them, and direct supervision
was impossible. In 1808 another act for farming the post-horse
duties was passed, modifying somewhat the provisions of the previous
act. The tax was to extend to horses used in travelling, when
hired by the mile or stage and when hired for a period of time less
than twenty-eight days for drawing carriages used in travelling
post. Persons licenced to let horses were required to have their
names and places of abode painted on their post carriages if they
provided these also. The carriages must have numbers painted on
them so as to distinguish them easily.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> In 1823 all previous acts
relating to licences and fees for keeping horses for hire were repealed,
and a complete system of rates was substituted. Every postmaster
or other person keeping horses to hire for riding by post must pay
an annual licence of five shillings and additional duties calculated
according to distance or time. The Treasury was given authority
to let these duties to farm.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center"><b>ROADS AND SPEED</b></p>


<p>Sir Brian Tuke, writing in 1533, said that the only roads in the
kingdom over which letters were regularly conveyed were from
London to Dover and London to Berwick.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The road to Berwick
had been in use in 1509<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> but had evidently been discontinued, for
Sir Brian says in his letter that postmen were appointed to it in
the year that he wrote. Regular posts were established between
London and Portsmouth when the fleet was there and discontinued
as soon as it left, so that it can hardly be included among the regular
roads.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Between 1580 and the accession of James I, there was a
distinct revival in postal affairs within and without the kingdom.
The posts on the London-Holyhead road had been discharged for
some time and Irish letters were conveyed to London by the postmaster
at Chester.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> In 1581 Gascoyne, the acting Postmaster-General,
was ordered to appoint stages and postmen on this old route.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
A letter patent was issued, calling upon all Her Majesty's officers
to assist him in so doing, and a warrant was signed for the payment
of £20 to defray his expenses. The Rye-Dieppe posts were also
reorganized, principally for the conveyance of letters to and from
France.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Bristol ranked next to London in size and importance,
but it was not until 1580 that orders were given to horse and man
the road between the two cities,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> and only in the following decade
were posts also laid from London to Exeter and somewhat later
from Exeter to Plymouth.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> This illustrates as well as anything the
fact that the early English postal system was mainly political in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98">[98]</a></span>
its aims. The great post roads were important from a political
rather than an economic standpoint. It was necessary to keep in
close touch with Scotland because the Scotch would always stand
watching. The wild Irish needed a strong hand and it was expedient
that English statesmen should be well acquainted with things
Irish. The post to and from the continent was quite as necessary
to keep them informed of French and Spanish politics.</p>

<p>In conveying letters the postman who started with them did not,
on the regular roads, proceed through to the place where they were
directed, but carried them only over his stage to the next postman.
By this method a fair rate of speed should have been maintained,
for the horses' path in the middle of the road was as a rule not
so bad as seriously to impede travelling.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Nevertheless complaints
about the tardiness of the post are numerous. Lisle, the Warden of
the Marches, said that letters from London were nearly five days
in reaching him at Alnwick.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Nine days from London to Carlisle
was considered too slow but it often took that long, notwithstanding
that the letters were marked twice "for life, for life."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The Earl
of Sussex complained to Cecil that they never arrived in York
under three days. He expected too much, however, for three days
from London to York was considered good speed.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> According to a
post label made out in 1589, the distance from Berwick to Huntingdon
was accomplished in ninety-one hours. By the mileage tables
then published, the distance was 203 miles, giving an average speed
of only a little over two miles an hour. It is only fair to add that
the real distance was 282 miles, and this would raise the speed to
about three miles an hour.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The distance from Dover to London
was covered in twelve hours, from Plymouth to Hartford Bridge
in forty-four hours, from Portsmouth to Farnham in five hours,
from Weymouth to Staines via Sherborne in five days, but this
must have been exceptionally long.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Orders were given to the postmen in 1603 that they should not
delay the mails more than fifteen minutes at each stage and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99">[99]</a></span>they should travel at the rate of seven miles an hour in summer and
five in winter.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> This was an ideal but seldom realized. Complaints
continued to come in pretty constantly during the first thirty-five
years of the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Secretary Conway wrote to
Secretary Coke that the posts must be punished for their tardiness.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
Even those from London to Dover were reprimanded and
they had hitherto given the best satisfaction. The postmaster at
Dover was threatened with imprisonment unless he mended his
ways.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Letters were either not delivered at all or were needlessly
delayed on the road. Some of the postmasters, who held lucrative
positions, were themselves absentees and their work was performed
by their agents, who were often incompetent, and this sort of thing
was connived at by the Postmaster-General, from whom their positions
were bought. The postmen themselves acknowledged their
tardiness but said that they were able to do no better, since they
had received no wages for several years.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> One had been paid
nothing for over two years, another had received no wages for
seven years,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and finally in 1628 a petition was presented to the
Privy Council from "all the posts in England, being in number
ninety-nine poor men." This petition prays for their arrears, due
since 1621, the amount unpaid being £22,626, "notwithstanding
the great charge they are at in the keeping of many servants and
horses to do His Majesty's service."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> The Council did not grant
their petition, for two years later £25,000 were still due them.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The Council of State gave directions in 1652 for roads to be
manned between Dover and Portsmouth, Portsmouth and Salisbury,
London and Yarmouth, and London and Carlisle through
Lancaster.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Hitherto, Carlisle had to depend upon a branch post
from the great North Road. Dover and Portsmouth had no direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100">[100]</a></span>connection nor had Bristol and Exeter, but letters between these
places passed through London. These orders formed part of the
directions given to the farmer of the posts in the following year.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
Cromwell seems to have recognized the impracticability of enforcing
the speed limit ordered by Elizabeth in the case of the ordinary
mails. He issued orders that in future only public despatches
or letters from and to certain high officials should be sent by express,
and such despatches and letters must be carried at a speed
of seven miles an hour from the first of April to the thirtieth of
September, and five miles an hour the rest of the year.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>Toward the close of the seventeenth century, more attention
was directed to the slowness of the posts and the delays along the
road. The average speed on the great roads varied from three to
four miles an hour, anything below three miles generally calling
for reproof. For instance, the posts on the Portsmouth road were
reprimanded for travelling only twenty-two miles in ten hours.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> It
was said that it took the Yarmouth mail sixty-six hours to travel
less than one hundred miles. The post labels were an important
check upon the postmaster's carelessness. Each postmaster was
supposed to mark the time that he received the mail on a label attached
to it for that purpose. In this way no postmaster marked the
speed that his own postboy made and each was a check upon his
neighbour.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Lord Arlington gave orders in 1666 for this practice to
be enforced more strictly. In addition to marking the time of arrival,
the time of departure was also to be added.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> A year later a
further improvement was made by the use of printed labels, containing
also directions as to speed. The names of the post towns
through which the mail must pass were also added, and blanks were
left for the postmasters to fill in the hours of arrival and departure.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>It was often difficult to tell the relative position of places in England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101">[101]</a></span>from the post towns. The Post Office had for its own use a
table of places along the great roads,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> and from the middle of the
seventeenth century, private individuals began to publish road
maps. On these maps, the post towns are marked by a castle with
a flag flying from it. Some of them are quite artistically done and
represent on a large scale every important road in England with
the places where branch roads leave them. One map has each road
outlined on a long scroll, and it gives the rivers, brooks, bridges,
elevations, villages, post towns, forests, and branch roads throughout
the whole distance.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> In 1668, Hicks, in writing to Arlington's
secretary, advised him not to have a new map of the post roads
printed, fearing the great changes that might thereby be produced
in the Post Office. He says: "When Parliament sees how all the
branches lie and most of them carried on at the charge of those
in the country concerned, they will try to have them carried
through by the Postmaster-General, which will be very chargeable."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the seventeenth century, the five great roads to
Edinburgh, Holyhead, Bristol, Plymouth, and Dover remained
practically unchanged. The Plymouth road had been continued to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102">[102]</a></span>Falmouth and the Northern Road now passed through York. The
greatest changes noticeable are in the Southern and Eastern counties.
In the South, nearly all the coast towns were now connected
with the Falmouth road, and the post ran to the extreme southwest
of Cornwall. Portsmouth had a direct service from London
through Arundel and Chichester. There were branches from the
Falmouth road to several towns in Dorset and Somerset, but as
a rule the country between the two great roads to the West was
poorly supplied. A new road of considerable importance ran from
Maidenhead on the Bristol road through Abingdon, Gloucester,
Cardiff, and Swansea to Milford, where there was a packet boat for
Ireland. From this road there were a few unimportant branches to
the North.</p>

<p>In the Northeast, the post road to Edinburgh now passed
through York to Northallerton. From York there was a branch
to Scarborough and Whitby. A new road left the Edinburgh road
at Royston, about forty miles from London, and passed along
the coast nearly parallel to the great road, through Newmarket,
Lynn, Boston, and Hull to Bridlington. Another branch left Newmarket
for Norwich and the seacoast towns of northern Norfolk.
An important road left London for Yarmouth, with branches to
the coast towns of Suffolk. One new road ran through the midland
counties, leaving the Holyhead road about thirty miles
from London and passing through Sheffield, Manchester, and Preston
to Carlisle. Derby was supplied by an east and west road
from Grimsby to Manchester. Liverpool had a post road to Manchester.
In 1683, provision was made for an extension of the post
roads by an order issued to the Postmaster-General to set up
posts between the market towns and the nearest post towns.
These were called bye-posts. It was to them that Hicks had objected
as leading to increased expense. At the same time orders
were given for a map to be printed, showing where all these bye-posts
were situated so that people might know where to address
their letters.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>In Ireland, there were three main post roads, running from
Dublin through Ulster, Munster, and Connaught.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103">[103]</a></span>practically no post roads worthy of the name in Scotland. That
part of the great North Road beyond the Tweed was English rather
than Scotch. Between Edinburgh and Glasgow there was a foot-post.
The mail was also carried between Glasgow and Portpatrick.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
In 1699, the length of the roads in America over which
the mails passed was 700 miles. These roads connected the principal
towns along the Atlantic coast.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>In 1696, the Postmaster-General reported favourably on the
establishment of a cross post road between Bristol and Exeter.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
The report was approved, and two years later Bristol and Exeter
had direct postal communication. Colonial and foreign letters for
Bristol, after their arrival in Falmouth, still went via London.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
Towns adjacent to Bristol and Exeter, which might have been connected
with the cross post, remained separated. For example,
the post went from London through Cirencester to Wotton-under-Edge,
which was within fourteen miles of Bristol, yet letters
from Cirencester to Exeter went via London.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The Exeter-Bristol
cross post proved a success. After it had been in operation
three years, it produced over £350 net profits a year. The use
of cross posts was advocated as leading to the conveyance of
a larger number of letters, and private individuals started to
establish them.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> In 1700, the post road from Exeter to Bristol
was continued to Chester through Worcester and Shrewsbury.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
Three years later, a direct road was ordered between Exeter and
Truro, but it seems to have been discontinued after one year's
trial.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>The post roads throughout the kingdom had not been measured
correctly. A mile on the London-Edinburgh road was fully ten
furlongs. This had resulted in a decreased revenue from post
horses and often unjustifiable reprimands for slowness. By a provision
in the act of 1711, it was ordered that all the post roads in
the kingdom should be measured. This was to be done by officials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104">[104]</a></span>appointed by the Postmaster-General and the measurements left
in the general offices in London, Edinburgh, and Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>As the seventeenth century had seen the extension of roads in
the southern and eastern counties of England, so the eighteenth
century was marked by the establishment of posts in those parts
of the kingdom most affected by the industrial revolution. The
country about Birmingham, Kidderminster, and Worcester was to
share in the better postal facilities offered by the mail coaches.
Lancashire and the West Riding of York were not debarred from
the use of Palmer's innovation. This was especially the case in
Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Halifax, and Leeds, for where
industrial expansion paved the way, the coaches were sure to follow.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century the roads in Ireland
were attracting considerable attention, and it was the slow speed
made by the mail carts there which was a primary cause in producing
any improvement. The Postmasters-General were directed
to cause surveys to be made and maps drawn of those roads in Ireland
over which the mail passed. The roads were to be levelled
so that the ascent or descent should be no more than one foot in
thirty-five wherever this was practicable, the expense to be borne
by the county or barony.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> This was in 1805, and the next year the
Grand Jury was given the power to call for another survey, and
the surveyor whom they appointed was to decide as to the necessity
for a change in the direction of the road. Copies of all Grand Jury
presentments were to be made to the Postmasters-General.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> In
1813 the Grand Juries were empowered to present for damages
accruing to owners and occupiers of land, such damages to be
raised by the county and advanced from the consolidated fund.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>After 1817, the Postmasters-General were able to report a considerable
acceleration in the speed at which the mails were carried.
This was owing largely to the introduction of a lighter and more improved
type of mail coach, and after 1821 the use of steam packet boats
in the case of the transportation of the Irish and continental
mails. Letters leaving London at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on Tuesday for Ireland
had not been delivered in Dublin until 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on Friday. In 1817
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105">[105]</a></span>they arrived on Thursday in time for delivery on that day.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> In
1828, the coaches travelled from London to Holyhead, a distance
of 261 miles, in twenty-nine hours and seventeen minutes. Four
years later the time had been reduced to twenty-eight hours.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> By
the introduction of one of the patent mail coaches on the Yarmouth
road, the inhabitants of that town were enabled to answer their
letters a day earlier. The coach left London at the usual time
(8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>), arriving in Yarmouth at 11.40 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, returning at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on
the same day.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The mails to Manchester and Liverpool travelled at
the rate of nine miles an hour over the greater part of the road.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
The average speed varied from eight to nine miles an hour. To
give the exact figures, the highest speed attained in England was
ten miles and five furlongs an hour, the slowest six miles, and the
average eight miles and seven furlongs.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> In Ireland the highest
speed attained by the mail coaches was nine miles and one furlong
an hour, the slowest speed six miles and seven furlongs, and the
average eight miles and two furlongs.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Mail carts drawn by two
horses were also used largely in Ireland for the conveyance of the
mails, and by these the speed was not so great. The highest speed
made by them was seven miles and five furlongs an hour, the slowest
five miles and one furlong, and the average six miles and three furlongs.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106">[106]</a></span>In Scotland the highest speed was ten miles and four furlongs
an hour, the slowest seven miles, and the average eight miles
and two furlongs.

<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>The mails which left London at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> arrived in Holyhead at
12.6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on the next day but one. The packet left Holyhead
twenty-five minutes later for Howth. The packet left Howth at
4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> for Holyhead, and the mails for London left Holyhead at
12.15 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The passage across the Irish Sea took from five to eight
hours. The London coach arrived in Milford at 5.27 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, travelling
at a rate of eight miles an hour, and twenty-five minutes after
its arrival, the packet left for Dunmore. Another left Dunmore
with the mails at 12 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and the coach left Milford for London
at 7.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span><a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> The London mail coach arrived at Portpatrick at
10.27 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, fifty hours and twenty-seven minutes from London.
The packet did not leave Portpatrick until 6.10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, after the
arrival of the Glasgow mail, which left Glasgow at 4.45 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, arriving
at 5.6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The packet left Donaghadee at noon, and the mail
left Portpatrick at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, arriving in Glasgow at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Ordinarily
the passage across took four hours. The London mail coach arrived
in Liverpool at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, twenty-two hours from London, and
left at 10.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Packets sailed from Liverpool and Kingstown at
5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and 5.15 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, the time for crossing being about fourteen
hours. No London letters went via Liverpool until 1841.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>The method used to ensure a rapid transmission of the mails by
the coaches was as follows: Time bills were issued to the guards of
the different coaches. On these bills were printed the speed that
should be made from stage to stage, and it was the guard's duty to
fill in the time made by the coach on which he rode. Penalties
were inflicted for any mistakes which he might make or any failure
on his part to leave the bill in the office at the end of his route. On
some of the time bills it was set forth that a fine of one shilling was
payable by the proprietor for each minute that the coach was late
and he might recover it from the guard or coachman if the delay
was due to the negligence of either of them. The coachmen were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107">[107]</a></span>ordered to make up any time lost on the road and to report the
horse keepers if they were at fault.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>The chief cause for delay was the lack of close connection between
the mail coaches and the packets to and from Ireland. In 1837 the
London mail arrived in Holyhead at 11 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, but the packet did
not leave for Kingstown until 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, a change having been made in
the time of sailing.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Letters from England were detained in Dublin
eleven hours before their departure for the rest of the island.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
More than one third of the Irish letters for England left Kingstown
by the day packet at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, remaining in Holyhead from 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to
4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, with the exception of the letters for Chester and Manchester,
which were forwarded by a special coach.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>The packets from Liverpool started shortly before the arrival of
the London mail. The Commissioners proposed that they should
be detained until it had arrived, but this was not done until
ten years later.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The packets at Portpatrick always waited for the
mails from Glasgow, and as these were nearly always late, letters
from Carlisle and Northern England were necessarily detained.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
The station at Milford had always given the most trouble. From
a financial point of view it was the least satisfactory, and English
letters for the south of Ireland often went through Holyhead. The
packet left Waterford<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> for Milford at 12 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, arriving in Milford
about noon, but the mail did not leave for London until 7.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span><a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
English letters for Ireland via Milford were detained from ten to
thirteen hours in Waterford.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Before the introduction of Penny Postage, the use of railways had
only started. In 1837, it was objected that the railways could never
be of much use in this respect because they could not travel at night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108">[108]</a></span>for fear of accidents. In answer to this objection it was pointed out
that trains between Liverpool and Manchester and Leeds and Selby
found no difficulty in that respect.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> In 1837, mails were carried
between Manchester and Liverpool at a rate of twenty miles an
hour, and these trains left both Liverpool and Manchester as late
as 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span><a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The Postmaster-General was given authority by Parliament
to require any railway to carry mails either by ordinary or
special train and to regulate the speed to the maximum of the fastest
passenger train, as well as to control places, times and duration
of stoppage and the times of arrival, provided that such regulations
were reasonable. He might require the exclusive use of a carriage, if
necessary, provided either by the railway or himself as seemed better
to himself. In 1844 he was allowed to order a speed not in excess of
twenty-seven miles an hour but he complained that he was unable
to enforce his regulations although the speed was increasing. In
1855 a parliamentary committee reported in favour of a deduction
of payment for irregularity on the part of the railways and the
fining of the Post Office for irregularity in dealing with mail to be
entrusted to the railways, the amounts of such deductions and fines
to be a matter of contract, and in addition it was advised that the
Postmaster-General's demands with reference to speed should be
certified by the Railway Department of the Board of Trade to be
consistent with safety. In conformity with this resolution, the
Postmaster-General proposed to pay a bonus to the railways
when their trains were on time and to exact a penalty from either
the railway or the Post Office whichever were the offender, but
the proposition was, as a rule, not very favourably received by the
railways.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center"><b>SAILING PACKETS AND FOREIGN CONNECTIONS</b></p>


<p>The Irish mail service was the first to boast a regular sailing
packet.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The postal expenditure for the year 1598 included £130
for a bark to carry letters and despatches between Holyhead
and Dublin, and an additional vessel was hired occasionally for
the same purpose.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> At the beginning of the seventeenth century,
Queen Elizabeth ordered packets to be established at Milford
Haven and Falmouth to ply between England and Ireland. This
order was probably temporary, being intended to furnish a means
of communication only during Essex's expedition.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> In 1649 the
port of departure for the Irish packets was changed from Holyhead
to Portinllain in Carnarvon and at the same time the land stages
were altered to meet the new conditions.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Prideaux reported the
same year that the cost of these packets averaged £600 a year.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>In 1653 the Council of State gave orders for the revival of the old
packet service between Milford and Waterford. At the same time
Chester was substituted for Portinllain as the point of departure
on the English side, and mails were carried weekly between the two
countries by the Milford and Chester Packets.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> The establishment
of these boats was made one of the conditions under which the post
was farmed in the same year.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> The situation of Holyhead, however,
was so much in its favour that in 1693 a contract was signed
for the conveyance of the mails between Holyhead and Dublin.
Mr. Vickers, the contractor, agreed to maintain three packet boats
for this purpose for £450 a year. He also undertook to provide two
boats for the mail service between Portpatrick and Donaghadee.
When the Scotch was separated from the English Post Office in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110">[110]</a></span>1695, three packet boats came under the control of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Upon
the separation of the British and Irish Posts in 1784, it was provided
that each office should receive its own proportion of the inland
postage collected on letters passing between the two countries.
The packet service between the two countries continued to be managed
by the English Postmaster-General, to whom all receipts were
forwarded. In return for this they were required to pay to the Irish
Office a sum not exceeding £4000 a year. This was to be the rule
until Ireland had established packet boats of her own.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The Irish Post Office, before the Act of Union, had employed
boats called wherries for the despatch of special messengers and
expresses to England. In the course of time they lost their special
character and, after 1801, were used to carry passengers and goods
in opposition to the Holyhead packets. In 1813, Lees, the Secretary
of the Irish Office, informed the London Office that these
wherries would henceforth be employed to carry the Irish mails to
Holyhead. This was actually done for six weeks and the regular
packets arrived on the English side without the mail, which was
brought by boats that, as a rule, did not arrive until after the coach
had left for London. Lees may have been obstinate and ill advised
but there was no doubt that he was acting entirely within his
rights. The question then arose, should the Irish Office receive
that part of the £4000 due them while the Holyhead packets did
not carry the mails? The Postmaster-General decided that they
should, much to Freeling's disgust. Lees had obtained his object,
for two years later Parliament passed an act increasing the amount
payable to the Irish Office to £8000 a year.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the Restoration, two packet boats were employed
between Deal and the Downs. They carried letters to and from
the ships of the merchant marine and the Royal Navy lying there.
They also collected letters from vessels arriving from foreign ports
and brought them to the shore whence they were transmitted by
the General Post.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> By an act passed in 1767 the Isle of Man was
for the first time supplied with a postal service. A packet boat was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111">[111]</a></span>to run between Whitehaven and the Port of Douglas in the island.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
In 1828 sixteen packet boats were employed in carrying mails
between the coast towns and to and from the outlying islands of the
United Kingdom. All of these boats were hired by the Post Office,
except those from Weymouth to Jersey and Guernsey.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>Early in the sixteenth century Dover was the port of departure
and arrival for letters to and from the continent, and Calais was the
distributing point on the other side, although the royal mail was
occasionally conveyed between Rye and Dieppe.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> From Calais the
letters were carried to their destination by the English messengers
to whom they were entrusted. They took up post horses along the
way, paying for them as they proceeded, and often grumbling at
the excessive charges which were demanded.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Letters from abroad
directed to England were usually carried as far as Calais by foreign
messengers. The foreign Postmaster-General would then send his
bill to the English Postmaster-General for expenses so incurred.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
Regular sailing packets were not used to carry the mails between
Dover and Calais during the sixteenth century, but merchant vessels
were employed by the Post Office.</p>

<p>Witherings' appointment as Foreign Postmaster-General in 1632
was made the occasion for a report to Sir John Coke on the foreign
postal service. The immediate cause of the report was the fact
that mails had not arrived from Germany, the Hague and Brussels.
The fault was laid upon the messengers, who were accused of
"minding their own peddling traffic more than the service of the
state or the merchants, omitting many packages, sometimes staying
for the vending of their own commodities, many times through
neglect or lying in tippling houses." The report goes on to express
confidence in Witherings and in his plan for the reform of the foreign
post.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> In 1631, thirteen messengers were employed to carry
letters to the continent: three for France; six for Germany, Italy
and the Netherlands; and four, who travelled to Paris and other
parts of France on special occasions.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The service which they gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112">[112]</a></span>was inadequate and slow, and in 1633 the foreign post, at Witherings'
suggestion, was ordered to be conducted on the following
principles. Packet posts were to be appointed at suitable stages to
run day and night without stopping. This was the plan which was
commented upon favourably in the report to Sir John Coke. The
Foreign Postmaster-General was to take the oaths of Allegiance
and Supremacy, to have an office in London, and to give notice
at what time the public were to bring in their letters for despatch
to the continent. A register was also to be kept, in which should
be enrolled the names of all persons bringing letters, together with
the names of those to whom they were addressed. The letters
themselves were placed in a packet and locked and sealed with
the Foreign Postmaster-General's seal. Letters from abroad for
ambassadors residing in England and for the Government were
to be delivered at once, after which a table of all other letters was
to be set up for every one to see and demand his own.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>Witherings attempted next to come to some agreement with the
postal officials of foreign countries about the despatch of letters. In
Calais he met the Countess Taxis, secretary of the Postmaster of
Ghent, and she agreed to settle stages between Antwerp and
Calais. Witherings himself established stages between London
and Dover. There had always been trouble with the boatmen who
conveyed the mail between Dover and Calais. Witherings reported
that he had found a man, who for 40s. would wait for the packet
and depart with it at once, carrying nothing else. The messengers
hitherto employed between Antwerp and Calais were dismissed.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
The arrangement in France for the carriage of letters to and from
England was decidedly unique. Witherings obtained the permission
of the French ambassador to settle stages in France himself.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>In 1644, King Charles, from his headquarters at Oxford, ordered
sailing packets to be established at Weymouth to ply between that
town and Cherbourg. This was done ostensibly for the accommodation
of the merchants in the southwest of England. James
Hicks was ordered to live in Weymouth for the purpose of exercising
a general oversight over all letters going or coming by these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113">[113]</a></span>packets. All dues must be paid before they were allowed to depart
and the masters were accountable to him for passage money. Postage
was charged on all letters going to or coming from any part of
England except those on His Majesty's service. No letters were
to be sent from those parts of England in the hands of the rebels.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Until 1638, Flanders was the only country with which England
had come to an agreement concerning the mutual exchange of
the correspondence of each. In that year, a similar agreement was
concluded with de Nouveau, the French Postmaster-General. All
letters between England and France were henceforth to pass
through Dover, Calais, Boulogne, Abbeville, and Amiens. Both
the French and English kings ratified this agreement, and all
others were prohibited by them from infringing upon the monopolies
enjoyed by the two Postmasters-General.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> On special occasions,
of course, both the French and English kings sent special messengers
but they were not used so often as before.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> In 1640, the
Governor of the Merchant Adventurers was asked to give his
opinion upon the question of foreign correspondence concerning
which there was considerable dissatisfaction, especially in the case
of letters sent to Flanders and Holland. The Governor in his reply
said that complaints had hitherto been restrained because of the
connection of the state with the foreign post. He added that some
time before a letter had come from the Court of their company at
Rotterdam, complaining about the overcharging of the Company's
letters. He did not care to investigate the question alone but proposed
that it be entrusted to a committee composed of two members
from each of the great companies, the Merchant Adventurers,
the Turkish, the Eastland, and the French.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> After the Restoration,
matters were adjusted with de Nouveau and provision was
made for the transmission of letters to England twice a week.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> At
the same time an attempt was made to reach an understanding
with the burgomaster of Amsterdam and the Dutch ambassador for
the conveyance of English letters to Germany, the East, and Italy
through Holland. Bishop, the English Postmaster-General, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114">[114]</a></span>accused of accepting money for making this bargain and the proposed
agreement did not materialize.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> In 1665, Frizell was sent
abroad to talk over postal connections with de Nouveau and the
Flemish Postmaster-General, de Taxis, between whom difficulties
had arisen. De Taxis was reminded that letters from Holland for
England passing through Flanders were not treated in accordance
with the agreement made between England and Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The
old contract was continued, for in 1693 a bill was presented to the
English Post Office by the next in order of the House of Thurn and
Taxis, referring to the former agreement. £2711 was then due to
the Flemish Postmaster-General and, as the bill was presented in
the form of a petition signed by the Prince of the House and his
brothers and sisters, there was probably some difficulty experienced
in collecting it.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The Dutch were not satisfied with receiving letters
through Flanders, and in 1667 we find the Postmaster-General
of Holland in Harwich, arranging for a direct service with England,
which was established in the following year.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Letters to and
from Holland might go via Calais through France and Flanders,
or by sailing packet to Nieuport and thence through Flanders, or
directly from Harwich to Helvoetsluys. The mail for Holland left
London every Tuesday and Thursday night. The route was along
the Yarmouth road as far as Colchester and then directly to Harwich.
The Harwich boats were stopped for a short time in 1672,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
but after William's accession they were in such constant service
that it was necessary to hire extra boats.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Orders were often given
to delay them until the arrival of an express from the King and on
other occasions they were hurried off before their regular time for
departure.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>It was agreed by a contract signed by the French and English
Postmasters-General in 1698 that the mails, as soon as they arrived
in Dover from Calais or in Calais from Dover, should be forwarded
by "express" to London and Paris respectively. This was done in
England, but in France the foreign mail continued to be sent at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115">[115]</a></span>regular time of departure and, as there was only one mail a day,
English letters might have to remain in Calais for nearly twenty-four
hours, if the packet from Dover happened to be late. Cotton
and Frankland remonstrated but Mr. Pajot, the French Postmaster-General,
returned no answer. The English Postmasters-General
had agreed to pay about £2500 a year to Mr. Pajot for the
conveyance of English letters through France. One or two instalments
were paid before the war broke out.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Nothing further was
done until after the Treaty of Utrecht, when a commission was
sent to France to negotiate a new postal agreement. Pajot refused
to accept a lump sum and declared that each letter passing through
France must pay the ordinary postage according to the French
rates. Objection was taken to this as the French rates were higher
than the English, but objections were of no avail. Pajot, who carried
matters with a high hand, gained his point. By the act of 1711,
the postage for a single letter through France to Italy was 15<i>d.</i>, and
by the terms of the new treaty with France, 21 sous would have to
be paid by the English Postmasters-General for the conveyance of
a letter through France.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>The withdrawal of the sailing packets between England and
France in 1689 had interrupted postal communication between
England and Spain, since the regular route lay through Calais. Accordingly,
packet boats were hired to ply between Falmouth and
the Groyne.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> After the Methuen treaty had been signed and while
England and France were struggling in the Spanish Netherlands, it
was proposed to replace the old boats between Falmouth and Lisbon
by new. In 1703 a weekly packet service, supplied by four
boats, was established between England and Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>At the end of the war, Cotton and Frankland contracted with
Mr. Macky to furnish five boats to carry the mails between England,
France, and Flanders for three years. In 1701, the contract
was extended to five years for £1400 a year. Macky was to provide
boats and men but not provisions and equipment. In case war
broke out, the contract would become void at once. War did break
out the next year,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> and during the war the packet boats from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116">[116]</a></span>Harwich to Holland were kept very busy. They had been large
boats, well manned and formidable enough to take care of themselves
in an emergency. They seem even to have become the aggressors
at times. William, himself, as was natural, felt a warm
interest in them. A stranger in a strange land, misunderstood and
personally unpopular, they were the link between him and his
home. He thought that speedier boats should be built and that
when pursued they should attempt to escape rather than stand up
to their pursuers. The government had four narrow, low boats
built for purposes of speed. The sailors complained that the new
boats were so low in the water that they were constantly being
swept by the waves and they themselves were drenched all the time.
There is no doubt that William's move was in the right direction,
and the men were placated by an increase in their wages. This
could be done the more easily since the new boats were smaller
than the old and carried fewer men.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>At the time of the War of the Austrian Succession, the Dover
packets were supplied by a man named Pybus. He agreed to carry
mails, passengers, and expresses from Dover to Calais and Ostend.
If he could not reach the latter place by sea he was to land the
mails and have them forwarded overland. He was to receive as pay
the fares of all passengers, but so many officers and soldiers had to
be transported free that he was paid what the Treasury considered
that he lost by them.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> A position in one of the packets was so dangerous
in time of war that a fund was provided for the widows and
children of the killed and for the support of the wounded. This was
met by deducting 10<i>d.</i> a month from the pay of each seaman.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>In 1803, as a war measure, packets were established between
Falmouth, Gibraltar, and Malta.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> It was understood that the regular
service to Portugal should be discontinued at the same time.
In 1812 during Wellington's campaign in Portugal and Spain, the
Post Office announced that sailing packets would be despatched to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117">[117]</a></span>Corunna every fortnight.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> From Corunna they proceeded to Lisbon
before returning to Falmouth. There was some complaint
from the mercantile interests on account of the stop at Corunna,
since the merchants were more interested in the Lisbon markets
than in keeping up communication with Wellington's army.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>By the end of 1813, Napoleon had lost control over Europe.
The Dutch had freed themselves from French domination. On
November 26th a Dutch mail was made up at the Post Office and
despatched for Harwich. The regular packet boats were reëstablished
and were ordered to land the mails at Scheveningen, a small
fishing town three miles from the Hague.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Following Napoleon's
expulsion to Elba, postal communications with France were resumed.
Mails were despatched from Dover four times a week, on
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, leaving London at
11 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on Tuesday and Friday and at 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on Wednesday and
Thursday.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Thirteen sailing vessels were stationed at Harwich in
1828, all of them hired permanently. Nine sailed between Harwich
and Helvoetsluys, four between Harwich and Gothenburg.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>The London merchants in 1837 complained that no mails were
made up in Paris for London on Wednesday and Thursday. The
mails from Spain, Italy, and Switzerland arrived in Paris on Tuesday
and Friday, and Tuesday's mails were not despatched until
Friday. An arrangement was asked for by which a daily post might
be established between Paris and London. They pointed out that
there was a daily post from Paris to Calais, a daily packet service
and a daily post from Dover to London.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> English letters for France
arrived in Dover daily at 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, except on Wednesday and Saturday,
were despatched to Calais at once and left Calais at noon
for Boulogne and Paris. On post nights,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> letters did not leave
London until midnight, arrived in Dover at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and were often
not in time for the Paris mail, which left Calais at noon.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118">[118]</a></span>packets between Dover and Ostend carried the mails four times a
week.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> By virtue of a treaty with Belgium, these packets conveyed
letters both ways and the Belgium Government paid £1000 a year
as its part of the expenses. The Dover-Calais boats on the other
hand carried letters only to Calais, and not from Calais to Dover.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
Letters from Belgium to Dover went first to London and this held
true of any letters from Belgium to England via Dover.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>It was provided in 1835 that, after the Postmaster-General had
entered into an agreement with any foreign state to collect and
account for the British postage on letters sent from the United
Kingdom to any such state, it should be optional for a person sending
such a letter to pay the whole amount of postage in advance or
to pay the British postage only, as had hitherto been the custom, or
to pay neither. The entire postage on letters from abroad might also
be paid in one sum and the part due the foreign state was then
handed over by the English Postmaster-General.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> In the following
year such a treaty was concluded with France, the English colonies
also being included in the arrangement. It was agreed that each
country should account to the other according to the method of
reckoning postage of the country to which the payment was made,
a settlement to be concluded every three months.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century William Dummer
entered into a contract to supply packet boats for use between
England and the West Indies. For this service Dummer provided
five boats, each one of 150 tons and carrying 50 men. Each was
to make three round trips a year, thus giving fifteen sailings every
twelve months from both England and the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> These
boats were to make Falmouth their home port, but they often kept
on to Plymouth, probably because it was a better place to dispose
of their smuggled goods.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> Poor Dummer was exceedingly unfortunate
with his West India boats. The first one to sail was captured
on her maiden trip. The receipts did not come up to his expectations.
<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>He had supposed that to double the receipts he had only
to double the rates, but like other men before and after him he had
to learn the effect of higher rates on correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> In 1706 he
wrote that it was a losing contract,<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> and in the same year the Government
released him from the agreement and paid him for two of
his lost packets.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> From a total of fourteen boats provided for the
packet service, he had lost nine. The Postmasters-General recommended
that for the future the packets should leave and arrive at
Bideford, which was less exposed to the enemies' privateers than
either Falmouth or Plymouth.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>After Dummer's failure, no attempt was made by the Post Office
to revive the service until 1745. In that year the Postmasters-General
reported to the Treasury in favour of regular packets
between Falmouth and some port in the West Indies. The report
was agreed to, and orders were given for two new boats to be supplied
and for the two boats between Lisbon and Gibraltar to be
transferred there.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> The agent at Falmouth was ordered to see that
each boat sailed with its full complement of men, as the captains
were accustomed to discharge some of the crew just before sailing
and pocket their wages. He was also to make sure that each of the
boats sailing from Falmouth for Lisbon, the West Indies, or North
America was British built and navigated by British seamen. He
must keep a journal, in which should be entered the time that he
received and delivered mails and expresses, how the wind and tide
served, when the boats arrived and departed, and any delay in sailing
which might occur. The captains were ordered to make returns
after each voyage of the number of men on board. The crew while
on shore should receive their accustomed wages and "victuals"
and, if any were discharged, a return was to be made of such discharge,
the money due them being turned over to the pension fund.
It had become customary for the captains not to pay the men while
they were on shore and to retain the money owing them. Finally
the agent was to see that the packet boats proceeded to the Roads
the day before the mail was expected from London.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Packets had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120">[120]</a></span>already been employed to convey mails to and from Madeira and
Brazil<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> and within the next few years others were hired to ply
between Falmouth, Buenos Ayres,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Colombia, Mexico, San Domingo,
and Cuba, and between the British West Indies, Colombia,
and Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>In 1815, the Postmaster-General was given permission by Act of
Parliament to establish sailing packets between the United Kingdom,
the Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, and that part of the East
Indies embraced within the charter of the East India Company.
Packet rates were also charged for letters carried by war vessels
and by vessels of the company, but in the former case the consent
of the Lords of the Admiralty for the use of their ships had first to
be obtained. Letters to and from China must go by vessels of the
company and no others. With the consent of the Commissioners
of the Treasury or any three of them, the Postmaster-General might
allow the regular sailing packets to import and export all goods,
which might legally be imported or exported, but in the case of tea,
only enough for the use of those on board should be carried.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>When Cotton and Frankland were appointed Postmasters-General
in 1691, the following sailing packets were in commission.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>In 1689, the King had ordered the boats between Dover and Calais
to be discontinued until further notice. This was done "on account
of the late discovery of treasonable designs against the Government"
and the war with France. His Majesty "preferred that all
interchange of letters with France should cease."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1744, the sailing packets of Great Britain and Ireland, excluding
those employed in the domestic service, were as follows: four
boats between Falmouth and Lisbon, four on the Harwich station,
six between Dover and Calais or Ostend, two between Gibraltar
and Lisbon, and two on the Minorca station. The use of sailing
packets to Gibraltar and Minorca was made necessary by the war.
From twenty to twenty-six additional men were added to each of
the eighteen packets as a protection against the enemy, and the
total additional yearly charge was £7045.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> This is one of the items
which made postal expenses run so high in time of war, to say nothing
of the packets captured by the enemy. The three boats
between Dover and Calais were sent to Harwich, Helvoetsluys, and
Ostend for the time being.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>The practice of the Post Office until 1821 had been to contract
for the supply of packet boats, paying only a nominal sum for their
hire and allowing the contractors to have the receipts from passengers.
In 1818 a private company established steamboats between
Holyhead and Dublin, and the public preferred these to the sailing
packets. The number of passengers by the government packets
fell off nearly one half. Something had to be done at once, for, as
the receipts from fares decreased, the contractors clamoured for
higher pay. The steamboat company offered to carry the mails for
£4 a trip and later for nothing, but the Post Office determined to
have steam packets of its own.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Two, built by Boulton and Watt,
under the inspection of the Navy Board, were placed on the Holyhead
station in 1821, and these, as well as those introduced later on
the other stations, were the property of the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>The fares by the steam packets at Holyhead were fixed at the
same rates as those charged by the company's boats and these
fares were somewhat higher than those formerly charged by the
sailing packets. For instance, the fee for a cabin passenger had
been one guinea, for a horse one guinea, and for a coach three
guineas. These were now raised to £1 5<i>s.</i>, £1 10<i>s.</i>, and £3 5<i>s.</i> respectively.
The new rates, which were so fixed in order not to
expose the company to undue competition, had not been long<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
enforced before the Select Committee on Irish Communications
reported against them, and the Post Office reduced them to the old
figures.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>In 1822 steam packets were placed on the Dover station, in 1824
they were introduced at Milford, in 1826 at Liverpool and Portpatrick,
and in 1827 at Weymouth.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> At Liverpool also a private
company had offered to carry the mails but the offer was refused.
This refusal, as well as the refusal to accept the Holyhead Company's
offer, was condemned in a report of the Commissioners.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
The new Liverpool packets ran from Liverpool to Kingstown, the
Holyhead packets from Holyhead to Kingstown and Howth.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> In
1828 the steam packets owned by the Crown numbered eighteen.
They were distributed as follows: four at Liverpool, two of 300,
one of 301 and one of 327 tons, all of 140 horse power; six at Holyhead,
varying from 230 to 237 tons, all of 80 horse power; four at
Milford, varying from 189 to 237 tons, all of 80 horse power; two
at Portpatrick of 130 tons and 40 horse power; and two at Dover of
110 tons and 50 horse power.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> Two years later, three steam
packets were added to the Weymouth station.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> In 1836, the Post
Office had in use twenty-six steam packets, one having been added
at Liverpool, three at Dover, and an extra one was kept for contingencies.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>With the exception of the Dover service for a few years, the
steam packets were always a financial loss to the Post Office. The
total disbursements for the Holyhead, Liverpool, Milford, and
Portpatrick stations from 1821 to 1829 were £681,648, the receipts
for the same period being only £250,999.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> From 1832 to 1837 the
disbursements for all the steam packets were £396,669, receipts
£180,167.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The Milford boats were the least productive of any.
From 1824 to 1836, the expenditure for that station was £220,986,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123">[123]</a></span>the receipts only £26,592. The Commissioners had pointed out
that not only was the practice of building and owning its own boats
a mistake on the part of the Post Office, but they were very badly
managed. For example, the stores for the Holyhead station were
obtained from the postmaster at Liverpool, who invariably
charged too much for them.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> At Portpatrick the goods were supplied
and the accounts checked in a very irregular manner.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> At
Dover the supplies were ordered by the mates, engineers, etc., as
they were needed and the bills paid by the Post Office. There was
no control over these officers, the accounts were not examined, and
the bills were not certified by the commanders. There was no proof
that the goods were even delivered. The agent, who forwarded the
bills, was not a seaman nor had he any knowledge of ships' stores.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
At Weymouth, where there were three steam packets for Jersey and
Guernsey, conditions were better. The agent was a practical seaman,
the demands for supplies were examined by him before being
granted, and were signed by him, by the commander, and by the
engineers or whoever needed them. The Commissioners also protested
against sending the Weymouth boats so far for repairs as
Holyhead, which was the regular repair station of the Post Office.
Apart from the steam packets stationed at Holyhead, Liverpool,
Milford, Portpatrick, Weymouth, and Dover, all the other packets
employed by the Post Office were hired permanently or temporarily.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>The Post Office was at no time entirely dependent upon its regular
sailing packets for the carriage of the mails. The merchant
marine of England had been increasing with her growing commerce,
and provision was made in the acts of 1657 and 1660 for the carriages
of letters by private vessels. By the latter of these acts the
conveyance of letters to foreign countries had been restricted to
English ships under a penalty of £100 for every offence. It was
decided in 1671, on the occasion of the wreck of one of the regular
Irish packets, that it would be better to use a Dutch-built ship
on account of its being much more seaworthy in the choppy swell
of the Irish sea. Accordingly an order-in-council was issued, allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124">[124]</a></span>a vessel built in Holland to be used, and providing for its
naturalization.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> By the act of 1660, letters arriving in private
vessels were to be given to the postmaster at the port of arrival
so that they might be forwarded to London to be despatched to
their destination after being charged with the postage due. Masters
of vessels were offered no inducement to deliver the letters to
the postmaster nor was any liability incurred by neglecting to do
so. The post farmers, however, agreed to pay a penny for every
letter delivered by a captain on his arrival. This was the origin of
ship letter money.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>No attempt had ever been made to collect postage on letters
conveyed by private ships except for the distance which such letters
might be carried by the regular posts within the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> In
1799 an act was passed under the following title: "An Act for the
more sure conveyance of ship letters and for granting to His Majesty
certain rates of postage thereon." The Postmasters-General
were given authority by this act to forward letters and packages by
other vessels than the sailing packets. On letters brought in by
such vessels, 4<i>d.</i> was to be charged for a single letter and so in proportion.
This was to be in addition to the inland postage and 2<i>d.</i>
was to be paid to the master for every letter handed over by him to
the Post Office. The net revenue so arising was to be paid into the
Exchequer. No postage was charged on letters carried out of the
kingdom by private vessels<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> until 1832, when permission was given
to charge packet rates. It was forbidden to send letters by these
ships except through the Post Office unless such letters concerned
only the goods on board.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> In 1835 that part of the act of 1711 forbidding
letters to be sent out of the kingdom except in British ships
was repealed.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>The sailing packets were ordinarily allowed to carry passengers
and freight, for which fixed rates were charged. In case of trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125">[125]</a></span>with any foreign power, the masters were generally forbidden to
allow their packets to be used as passenger boats.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> During King
William's war, the Harwich-Helvoetsluys packets carried recruits
free to the scene of activities.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> They had also been guilty of
bringing dutiable goods into the country and paying no duty on
them. This made the customs officials indignant, especially as the
Post Office authorities would not allow them to search the packets
on their arrival. By an act passed in 1662, no ship, vessel, or boat
ordinarily employed for the carriage of letters was allowed to
import or export any goods, unless permission had been given by
the customs officials, under a penalty of £100 to be paid by the
master of the offending packet boat.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> It had been agreed between
Dummer and the Post Office that he should carry no more than
five tons of merchandise outward bound nor more than ten tons
when homeward bound. The Commissioners of the Customs in
1708 advised the Lord High Treasurer that if he gave licences to
the packet boats to carry goods<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> it would be necessary to comply
with the law and subject the boats to searchers, rules, and penalties
as the merchantmen were. They proposed that the agreement
made with Dummer be applied to all the packets. They pointed out
that if this were done, all friction between the customs and Post
Office might be avoided.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> In 1732, the difficulty assumed a new
form over the question as to the carriage of dutiable goods by mail.
Diamonds had recently been discovered in Brazil and they were
exported to England via Spain. It had also become customary to
send fine laces by post. We, who have become used to intolerant
customs' regulations, can hardly appreciate the indignation
aroused by the desire of the customs' authorities to search the
mails. It was the rule at that time for the Controller of the Foreign
Office to lay a tax of 1 per cent upon packages which he thought
had lace or diamonds in them. The customs officials seized twenty-one
<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>parcels of diamonds in a mail bag, coming from Lisbon in the
packet <i>Hanover</i>. The Postmasters-General were very indignant
and wrote to the Treasury that they "would not have it left to
a customs' house officer to break open the King's mail, which has
never been done before."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Evidently the customs officials had
exceeded their authority and the matter was compromised by the
appointment of a sub-controller of the Foreign Post Office to act
under the authority of the Customs Commissioners and receive the
duties on diamonds and other jewels and precious stones imported
in the packet boats.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> In a report of the Postmasters-General somewhat
earlier, we are informed of a payment of £1087 made by them
to the Receiver-General of the Customs. This amount covered
four fifths of the gross duty on diamonds and laces, which had
come by the sailing packets during four years, one fifth having
been deducted for postage.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>By a section of the act of 1784, letters or packages from abroad
suspected of containing dutiable articles were to be taken by the
postmaster to a Justice of the Peace. He was to take an oath that
he suspected that dutiable goods were contained in the letter or
packet. In the presence of the justice he was then to cut a slit two
inches long in the parcel to permit examination of the contents. If
his suspicions seemed to be confirmed he might slit the cover
entirely open and if anything dutiable were found it must be destroyed.
The letter was then forwarded to the Commissioner of
the Customs in order that proceedings might be taken against
those implicated. If nothing was found, the letter was to be sent to
the person to whom it was addressed, under the magistrate's cover,
with no extra charge for postage.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>In one respect, the packet stations in England were conducted
on divergent principles. The supplies for the Harwich packets were
advanced directly by the Government through the Postmaster-General.
When the War of the Austrian Succession broke out, a
treasury warrant was issued for the supply of military stores and
eight additional men for each of the Harwich boats.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> At Falmouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127">[127]</a></span>the agent supplied all necessaries. Neither plan was entirely free
from objection. When the agent acted as victualler he naturally
tried to make as much as possible out of his contract, and there
were frequent complaints from the men on the Falmouth boats
concerning the quality and quantity of the food. At Harwich, the
drawbacks of the other method, under which the Post Office did its
own victualling, were quite as marked. No bill for provisions represented
what they had actually cost. A percentage was habitually
added to the actual cost and this percentage went into the
pockets of those by whom the goods had been ordered.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>The postal abuses which came to light in 1787 were more flagrant
in connection with the packet service than in any other department
of the Post Office. The Secretary himself was not only a large owner
in the boats, but as agent he received 2&#189;per cent of the gross total
expenditure. From 1770 to 1787, this had amounted to £1,038,133,
from which he had received over £25,000. Besides this, his salary
amounted to £1000 a year and there was an annuity of £100 attached
to his office. He had become too old to perform his duties,
but instead of being superannuated another person was appointed
to assist him.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The Sailors' Pension Fund was grossly mismanaged. Each sailor's
monthly contribution had been raised from 10<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> and
then 3<i>s.</i> After twenty years' service, the man who had kept up his
payments was entitled to receive £4 or £5 a year. The names of
dead people were retained on the list of pensioners, fictitious names
were added, and there seems no doubt that the agent retained the
money ostensibly paid out in their names.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The agent at Falmouth
had a salary of £230 a year and £160 in perquisites, £100 of which
were paid to the former agent's widow. The late agent had received
£430 a year in perquisites in addition to the regular £390
less £40 for a clerk and an assistant postmaster, making £780 in
all, certainly a comfortable salary for a packet agent at that time.
The £430 was made up by an involuntary contribution of five
guineas from each of the captains of the twenty-two packet boats
and the wages of one man from each boat. The latter sum was obtained
by dismissing the men, whose wages still continued to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128">[128]</a></span>paid&mdash;to the agent. Smuggling had become by no means uncommon
among the Falmouth boats, the carriage of the mails being
considered of secondary importance. They often arrived when
least expected, or they might not arrive for days at a time, although
the wind and weather were favourable.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>Fares for passengers were not always collected, but a moderate
payment to the captains would ensure a passage as they were allowed
to carry their friends free and the payment readily secured
the privilege desired. The agents also profited by the sale of passes.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
There were more boats on the Falmouth station than necessary,
and, although they ranged in size from 150 to 300 tons, the same
number of men were employed on each. The Secretary of the Post
Office, from whose report these facts about the packets are derived,
proposed that three or four of the boats should be taken
off, thus effecting a saving of £6000 or £8000. In case it should be
considered expedient to employ regular packet boats to Quebec
and Halifax, N. S., they might be placed on those stations. No deductions
were made for the hire of boats when they were unemployed,
either when being repaired or when under seizure for smuggling.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>The result of these exposures was a series of reforms started in
1793. By 1797 the Post Office was able to report that orders had
been issued forbidding any official to own a sailing packet or have
a share in any of them. Orders were given to pay the sailors regularly
throughout the whole year. The 2&#189; per cent on all expenditure,
formerly paid to the Secretary, was abolished. Finally all
salaries were henceforth to be in lieu of every emolument.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>In 1793, the expenses for packet boats amounted to £45,666 a
year. This was reduced in the following year to £36,940, but from
1795 expenses began to increase, owing to losses during the war and
the necessity for placing the boats on a war footing.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> In time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129">[129]</a></span>peace, a Falmouth packet of 179 tons carried twenty-one men, including
officers, at a total expenditure for men, interest, insurance,
and wear and tear, of £1681.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> In time of war, she carried twenty-eight
men, all of whom were paid higher wages, and other expenses
were also higher, bringing the total expenses for each packet to
£2112 a year.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> For a packet of seventy tons the expenses during
peace and war were respectively £536 and £862.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> It is not surprising
then that the cost for all the packet boats had risen in 1796 to
£77,599. The Falmouth boats were responsible for £60,444 of this,
the rest being divided amongst the Dover, Harwich, Donaghadee,
Milford, Weymouth, and Holyhead packets and the West India
schooners.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> The salaries paid to the agents in 1796 amounted to
£3412. They were stationed at Lisbon, Falmouth, Yarmouth (instead
of Harwich and Dover), Weymouth, Jamaica, Halifax, N. S.,
and Quebec. In Lisbon and the colonial towns, the agents acted
also as postmasters.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>In 1827, all the packets sailing out of Falmouth were transferred
to the Admiralty, in spite of Freeling's protest. The question had
been discussed again and again during the war with France but
why it was decided upon at this particular time is not clear. At the
time of transfer, thirty packets were employed at Falmouth, carrying
mails to and from Lisbon, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, the Mediterranean,
America, the Leeward Isles, Jamaica, Colombia, and Mexico.
In 1828, the number of packets at Falmouth had increased to
thirty-eight brigs of war and sailing vessels and in 1833 to forty-one.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>The Admiralty had exceedingly bad luck with the Falmouth
boats for the first seven years. During that time seven of them were
lost; four were wrecked, one was supposed to have been burned,
one was smashed to pieces by icebergs, and one was captured by
pirates off Rio Janeiro.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>In 1837, the charge of all the packets and the powers and authorities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130">[130]</a></span>then existing in the Postmaster-General under any contract
for the conveyance of mails were transferred to the Admiralty by
act of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> The Post Office was still to retain the discretionary
power of regulating the time of departure of the packets and
of receiving the reports of the agents when the mail was delayed.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>
In the same year, but by a later act, the Postmaster-General was
authorized to contract for the conveyance of letters by private
ships between any places whatever, but such ships must be British.
The rates were to be the same as the packet rates, but the owners,
charterers, and consignees of vessels inward bound were allowed to
receive letters free to the weight of six ounces, or twenty ounces in
the case of vessels coming from Ceylon, the East Indies, and the
Cape of Good Hope.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> For every letter retained by the captain or
any other person there was a penalty of £10. The captain was also
liable to a penalty for refusing to take the letter bags, even when no
contract had been signed.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>The control of the packets by the Admiralty after 1837 failed to
produce the results anticipated. The power of authorizing contracts
for the conveyance of the mails by water was actually vested in
the Lords of the Treasury upon consultation with the Postmaster-General,
the Colonial Secretary, and the Lords of the Admiralty
with reference to the postal, colonial, or nautical questions involved,
but as a matter of fact these officials did not always work in harmony.
The mails continued to be carried by private vessels or war
vessels not under contract, by packets belonging to the Crown, and
by vessels under contract. Before the use of steam vessels the
Government was able as a rule to make contracts for a short period
and at comparatively little cost. Between England and the neighbouring
countries (Ireland, France, and Belgium), government
steam packets were employed. For the longer voyages it was considered
advisable to induce commercial companies to build steam
vessels by offering large subsidies for long periods. In 1853, a Parliamentary
Committee reported in condemnation of the further
use of government-owned packets on account of their expense and
also of the payments to the owners of contract vessels in excess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131">[131]</a></span>of the actual cost of mail carriage. They pointed out, however,
that exceptions might very well be made when for political or social
reasons it seemed necessary to carry mails to places where commercial
vessels did not go, or went very irregularly, or where high
speed was desirable.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> This report, in so far as it condemned the use
of government-owned packets and the excessive subsidies paid to
contractors, repeated the findings of an earlier committee published
in 1849, which had in addition advised that the rule should
be observed of calling for tenders in the most public way possible.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
In 1852, the only service performed by the government packets was
that between Dover, Calais, and Ostend. On the French service
the night mails between Dover and Calais were conveyed by British
packets and the day mails by French. Between Dover and
Ostend there was a daily service, thrice a week by British, four
times by Belgian packets. Of the six boats employed by the Admiralty,
four were kept fully manned and two were spare steamers.
The receipts did not equal the gross expenses.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Again in 1860, the
year in which the control of the packets was transferred to the Post
Office, we find a third Parliamentary committee repeating the recommendations
of its predecessors so far as the subsidy question
was concerned. Nothing was said about the government steamers,
for in the meantime the principle of packet ownership had been
abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>A general review of the packet services existing at the middle of
the nineteenth century affords a very good example of the relative
importance of these different systems of communication and of the
principles on which the payment of subsidies was based. The inland
packet service of the United Kingdom included, among others, the
lines between Holyhead and Kingstown, Liverpool and the Isle
of Man, Aberdeen and Lerwick, Southampton and the Channel
Isles. This formed a necessary part of the inland postal service, and
no attempt was made to meet expenses by levying a sea-transit
postage. In the case of the Isle of Man the postage collected covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132">[132]</a></span>the cost of the packets and of the land establishment of the Post
Office in the island. The expenses of the Shetland packets by themselves
exceeded the postage collected, and the Orkney postal expenses
were also greater than the revenue.</p>

<p>The second class consisted of the packets plying between England
and the colonies or between the colonies themselves, and included
the lines to India, Australia, the Cape, the West Indies, and
British North America. This class was and is by far the most important.
Three-fourths of the whole annual subsidies paid by the
Government for the packet service were paid to three great companies,
the Peninsular and Oriental, the Royal Mail, and the Cunard
Company. The first of these connected England with India
and the Orient, the second with the West Indian colonies, and the
third with the North American Provinces. The great cost involved
in subsidizing these companies was excused on the ground of absolute
necessity for a regular and rapid mail service between the
mother country and her colonies. Of the lines furnishing communications
with foreign countries, several were connected with and subsidiary
to the colonial service, as the continuation of the Cunard
line to the United States. The service to China was the most
remunerative part of the system undertaken by the Peninsular
and Oriental boats, and the same may be said of the foreign service
of the Royal Mail Company. From a commercial point of view the
Continental packets were perhaps the most important of all.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>The first contract with an individual steamship company was
made in 1840 with the famous Cunard Company providing for
the conveyance of mails between Great Britain, the United States,
and Canada. In accordance with the recommendations of various
committees, attempts were made later to place the Atlantic packet
service upon a firmer financial basis so far as the loss to the Post
Office was concerned. In 1868, the contract with the Cunard Company,
which had been renewed at various times under somewhat
different conditions, came to an end. The Conservative Government
which was just going out arranged for two services a week
with the Cunard Company for £70,000, and one a week with the
Inman Company for £35,000. There was considerable opposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133">[133]</a></span>to the agreement among the Liberal majority of the new Parliament,
but it could not of course be repudiated. This contract came to
an end in 1876, and a circular was addressed to the various steamship
companies informing them that the government would hereafter
send the American mails by the most efficient ships, payment
to be made at the rate of 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a pound for letters and 2<i>d.</i> a pound
for other mail matter, those being the rates fixed by the Postal
Union Treaty and adopted by the American Government. The
Inman and White Star Companies refused at first to have anything
to do with the new system of payment, but eventually they fell into
line. The system was in operation for a year at a cost of £28,000
in place of the old charge of £105,000. The Cunard, Inman, and
White Star Companies then demanded double the previous rates
on the ground that they were conducting the service at a loss, and
an agreement with the Government was concluded for the payment
of 4<i>s.</i> a pound for letters and 4<i>d.</i> for newspapers, etc. At the same
time the old monopolistic conditions were virtually reëstablished,
for rival steamship lines were excluded from the agreement.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>In 1886, the agreement with the Cunard, Inman, and White
Star Lines came to an end. The Cunard and White Star Companies
then made an offer precluding the use of the fast boats of other
lines, but this was declined. Eventually an agreement was reached
at a reduced cost, which gave the Post Office the right to send letters
so directed by any other ships than those of the White Star or
Cunard Companies. The amounts to be paid were measured by
the actual weight of mail matter carried.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> The payments to the
Peninsular and Oriental Company were based at first entirely upon
mileage covered, and reductions were made if the packets fell below
a minimum speed agreed upon. This method was later changed to
a payment based upon the amount of mail carried, and the subsidy
was substantially reduced.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>A general review of the packet service in 1907 shows us that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134">[134]</a></span>most of the contracts for the home packets are terminable on six
months' notice, a few only on twelve months' notice. The Holyhead
and Kingstown service is exceptional, not being terminable
until 1917, or on twelve months' notice after 31st March, 1916.
This is by far the most important of any of the home systems and
costs £100,000, to be reduced to £80,000 in 1917. The contract for
the conveyance of mails between Dover and Calais is terminable
on twelve months' notice and cost £25,000 for the postal year
1906-07. The payments for the use of the other boats between the
United Kingdom and Europe are comparatively small, amounting
in 1906-07 to £3780 only, and all these contracts are terminable on
six months' notice. The contracts for the conveyance of the mails
to the two Americas are as a rule terminable on six or twelve
months' notice, but an exception has been made in the case of the
Cunard Company with whom and under peculiar circumstances a
twenty years' agreement was made in 1902. In 1906-07 the cost of
the conveyance of the mails between the United Kingdom and
North and South America was £198,488. The African contracts
are all terminable on three, six, or twelve months' notice, and
amounted in 1906-07 to £32,988. The carriage of the mails to
India, Australasia, and China for the year ending 31st March, 1907,
cost £402,162, but this has since been diminished by a reduction
in the subsidies to the Peninsular and Oriental Company and the
Canadian Pacific Railway Company.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>The total expenditure for packet boats increased enormously
after 1840, and this increase in cost kept down the net revenue of the
Post Office for many years after the introduction of penny postage.
In 1830, the packet expenses amounted only to £108,305, in 1846, to
£723,604, and in 1860, to £869,952. They reached the maximum
point of £1,056,798 in 1869, and from that time until 1890, when
they were £665,375, there has been on the whole a gradual diminution.
During the year ending 31st March, 1892, they reached the
sum of £701,081, for the postal year 1900-01 they were £764,804,
and during the year 1905-06 they had diminished to £687,109.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center"><b>RATES AND FINANCE</b></p>


<p>After de Quester had been appointed Foreign Postmaster-General,
he published, in 1626, an incomplete set of rates from and
to various places on the continent. His charges for "packets," and
by packets he meant letters or parcels carried by a special messenger,
were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
To the Hague £7.<br />
To Brussels or Paris £10.<br />
To Vienna £60.<br />
</p>

<p>The ordinary rates were:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
To or from any of the above places 30<i>s.</i><br />
To or from any part of Germany 6<i>s.</i><br />
From Venice for a single letter 9<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a><br />
From Venice for any letter over a single letter 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i><br />
From Leghorn and Florence for a single letter 1<i>s.</i><br />
From Leghorn and Florence over a single letter 3<i>s.</i> an ounce.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a><br />
</p>

<p>This system of rates, although crude, marks a distinct era in postal
progress. It forms the foundation of the plan which was perfected
a few years later by Witherings. De Quester also published a statement
of the days of departure of the regular posts with foreign letters.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
In the trial between Stanhope and de Quester over the question
of who should be Foreign Postmaster-General, it came out in
the evidence that Stanhope had been accustomed to receive 8<i>d.</i> for
every letter to Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Antwerp.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> This charge
was rather in the nature of a perquisite than a legal rate and serves
partly to explain why Stanhope was so anxious to retain the monopoly
of the foreign post.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>Witherings' rates for domestic postage, as fixed by Royal Proclamation
in 1635, were as follows for a single letter:&mdash;</p>


<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="1635 rates">
<tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="right"><i>d.</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">Under 80 miles</td>
<td class="left">2</td>
</tr><tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">Between 80 and 140 miles</td>
<td class="left">4</td>

<td style="margin-left: 5%;">Over 140 miles</td>
<td class="left">6</td>

<td style="margin-left: 5%;">On the Borders and in Scotland&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td class="left">8</td>
</tr><tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">In Ireland</td>
<td class="left">9</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If there were more than one sheet of paper, postage must be paid
according to the above rate for every separate sheet or enclosure.
For instance, a letter or packet composed of two sheets was called
a double letter and paid 4<i>d.</i> for any distance under 80 miles. A
letter of three sheets was called a triple letter and paid 6<i>d.</i> if conveyed
under 80 miles, and so in proportion.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> In 1638, the rules concerning
the imposition of rates were changed slightly. The rates
themselves remained the same for single and double letters. Letters
above double letters were to be charged according to weight
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="1635 rates">
<tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">Under 80 miles</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">6<i>d.</i> an ounce.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">From 80 to 140 miles&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">9<i>d.</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">Above 140 miles</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">12<i>d.</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">For Ireland</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">6<i>d.</i> if over two ounces.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This expedient must have been adopted from the difficulty in discovering
the number of enclosures when there were more than
two. It is impossible to say how long these rates continued, probably
not later than Witherings' régime. During Prideaux' management
the maximum postage on a single letter was 6<i>d.</i>, reduced
later to 3<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>The Council of State gave orders in 1652 for the imposition of
the following rates for a single letter:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="1652 rates">
<tr>
<td style="margin-left: 5%;">Within 100 miles from London</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">2</td>

<td style="margin-left: 5%;">To remoter parts of England and Wales&nbsp;</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>Whether these rates were actually collected is questionable. The
postage which the farmers of the Posts were allowed to collect in
the following year was fixed by the Council of State for single letters
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="1653 rates">

<p>These rates are in effect lower than those of Witherings, for he had
inserted a 3<i>d.</i> rate for letters delivered between 80 and 140 miles
from London, had charged 4<i>d.</i> for all letters going farther than
140 miles, and had charged 8<i>d.</i> and 9<i>d.</i> for letters to Scotland
and Ireland respectively. They were a little higher than those of
1652, for by them 2<i>d.</i> had carried a letter 100 miles.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>These rates are considerably lower than those of Witherings and
are essentially the same as those of 1653, except that the postage
is fixed for letters to and from the continent. No provision is made
for letters to and from any other part of the world but Europe. Since
the government had not established any postal communication
with Asia, Africa, or the Americas, it would have been unfair to
demand postage on letters conveyed by merchant vessels to and
from those places.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>The act of 1660 is generally referred to as bringing the Post
Office under Parliamentary control and as the basis of the modern
system. This is probably due to the fact that the act of 1657 was
passed by a Commonwealth Parliament and signed by Cromwell.
Whether its authors lacked the power to give it validity, they did
not lack the brains to pass an excellent act, and although the Royalists
saw fit, after the Restoration, to dub it the pretended act of
1657, they could not improve it and had the sense to leave it largely
untouched. The first act had imposed rates from or to any place
to or from London as a centre. It had been taken for granted that
all letters passed to, from, or through the capital, and to all intents
and purposes this was so. It was possible, however, for letters,
technically called bye-letters, to stop short of London, and it was
to provide for these that postage was to be reckoned from any
place where a letter might be posted.</p>

<p>Scotland was no longer a part of England after the Restoration,
so that by the act of 1660 rates were given to and from Berwick
and for single letters were a penny less than they had been to Scotland
under the earlier act. From Berwick the rate, within a radius
of forty miles, was 2<i>d.</i> for a single letter, and over forty miles, 4<i>d.</i>
As far as foreign postage was concerned, letters to the northern
coast towns of Italy paid 3<i>d.</i> less than the old rate for a single
letter. Other rates remained the same. Alternative routes were
sometimes offered. For instance, letters might be sent directly to
northern Italy or they might go via Lyons, but in the latter case
they cost 3<i>d.</i> more. Again, there were many more continental
towns to which letters might be sent and from which they might be
received. Letters for Germany via Hamburg had to be postpaid
<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>as far as that city. The same was true of letters to southern France
via Paris and of letters to northern Italy via Lyons. The highest
rate paid for a single letter was 1<i>s.</i> to northern Italy, Turkey, and
central and northern Germany. Merchants' accounts not exceeding
one sheet of paper, bills of exchange, invoices and bills of lading,
were to pay nothing over the charge of the letter in which they
might be enclosed. The same rule was to hold for the covers of
letters sent to Turkey via Marseilles. All inland letters were to be
paid for at the place where they were delivered unless the sender
wished to pay in advance.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>When the Scotch was separated from the English Post Office in
1695, rates were imposed by the Parliament of Scotland as follows:</p>

Scotch Post was let out to farm, the English Postmasters-General
advised that the farmers should be obliged to pay at Berwick the
postage on English and foreign letters for Scotland, and an order
in accordance with this advice was signed by the King. It was the
custom to change the farmers every three years, which may have
produced a larger revenue but was certainly not calculated to
increase the efficiency of the office. The English Postmasters-General
had great difficulty in collecting at Berwick the postage
due them, and it is doubtful whether a large part was ever paid.
The frequent changes in the farmers must have been an excellent
means of allowing them to escape their debts to the English.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>It has been customary to point to the postage rates of 1660 as
lower than any before the nineteenth century. This is true in a general
way, but one limitation to the statement is generally overlooked.
Before 1696 all posts ran to or from London, and it was
not until well on in the eighteenth century that the system of cross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140">[140]</a></span>posts was introduced. Bristol and Exeter are less than eighty miles
apart, but a letter from Bristol to Exeter went to London first and
from there to Exeter, travelling about 300 miles to reach a town
eighty miles distant. Now by the act of 1660, the rate for distances
above 80 miles was 3<i>d.</i> Thus the letter paid 3<i>d.</i> from Bristol to
London and 3<i>d.</i> more from London to Exeter, 6<i>d.</i> in all. If there
had been a direct post from Bristol to Exeter, and there was not
until 1698, the postage would have been 2<i>d.</i> only. The possibility
of such an anomaly as this must be kept in mind in considering the
low rates of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In James the Second's reign, a Post Office had been established
in Jamaica, and rates of postage had been settled not only in the
island itself but between it and the mother country. This was a new
departure, since at that time there were no packet boats to the
West Indies. The rate between England and Jamaica was 6<i>d.</i> for a
single letter, 1<i>s.</i> for a double letter, and 2<i>s.</i> an ounce. As the Crown
was not at the expense of maintaining means of transport, this was
a pure tax.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> In 1704, the postage on a single letter from the West
Indies was raised to 7&#189;<i>d.</i>, for a double letter 15<i>d.</i>, but Dummer's
packets were then in operation.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>In 1698, a system of posts had been established in the American
colonies between the largest towns on the Atlantic coast. All that
is known about the rates is that the charge for the conveyance of a
letter between Boston and New York was 1<i>s.</i> and the post went
weekly between those places.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> Hamilton, the deputy manager,
proposed that letters from England should be sent in sealed bags
entrusted to the masters of ships. The bags were to be handed over
to the postmaster of the port where the ship first touched and the
captain was to receive a penny for each letter. He advised that the
following rates should be adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p>These rates were said to be too high and were not adopted, "it
being found that cheap postage greatly encourages letter writing,
as is shown by the reduction in England from 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>The preamble to the act of 1711 offered as an explanation of an
increase in rates the necessity for money for the war and the prevention
of private competition in carrying letters. It is plain that
higher rates will, up to a certain point, increase proceeds, though
not proportionately, but how increased rates can decrease competition
is more difficult to explain. Witherings had found that the
cheaper he made postage, the less fear was there from interlopers.
It is possible that the framers of the bill had intended to use part
of the increase in revenue for the support of searchers, but no such
provision is contained in the act itself.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> On the ground that a large
revenue was necessary, no fault can be found with the increase. It
is probably true that in course of time lower rates would have increased
the product more than higher, but war and its demands
wait for no man. The people who could write and who needed to
write were in a small minority then, and their number could not
for a long time be influenced by lower rates. What was needed at
once was money and the only way to raise it by means of the Post
Office was the one adopted.</p>

<p>The rates for single letters within England and between England
and Edinburgh were increased by a penny for a single letter; for
double letters and parcels in proportion. To Dublin the charge
remained the same, and the rates within Ireland were not changed.
In the act of 1660, the postage on letters delivered in Scotland had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142">[142]</a></span>been reckoned from Berwick. Edinburgh was now made the centre

<p>The rates within Scotland were lower than those within England
and Ireland. Scotland had a 2<i>d.</i> rate for distances not exceeding
fifty miles. England had no rate under 3<i>d.</i>, except for the Penny
Post. Ireland, too, had a 2<i>d.</i> rate for distances not exceeding forty
miles, but for distances from forty to eighty miles and over, the rate
for Irish letters was 4<i>d.</i>, while in England the rate was only 3<i>d.</i> for
distances not exceeding eighty miles. The distances which letters
travelled within Scotland were shorter than in England and Ireland.
As a rule the different rates for the three countries varied with their
wealth and consequent ability to pay, the least being required from
poverty-stricken Scotland. The new rates as compared with the
old were for a single letter:<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>The act of 1660 imposed rates on letters in Scotland from
Berwick as a centre. By that act rates had been fixed for distances
not exceeding 40 miles and for distances over forty miles from
Berwick, being 2<i>d.</i> and 4<i>d.</i> for single letters for the respective distances,
so that by the act of 1711, the Scotch rates were lower than
they had been in 1660 and slightly higher than those of 1695. When
forty miles was made the lowest distance according to which rates
were levied, it was thought and intended that 2<i>d.</i>, the rate for that
distance, would pay for a single letter from Berwick to Edinburgh.
As a matter of fact, the distance between the two places was fifty
miles, so that the Scotch Act had estimated it better.</p>

<p>In the rates as given above, an exception is made in the case of
letters directed on board ship or brought by it. For such letters
one penny was charged in addition to the rates already given. This
extra penny was charged because the postmaster in the place where
the ship first touched was required to pay the master of the vessel
one penny for every letter received. Foreign letters collected or
delivered at any place between London and the port of departure or
arrival of the ship for which they were destined or by which they
had come, must pay the same rate as if they had left or arrived
in London.</p>

<p>As far as foreign post rates were concerned they were all from 1<i>d.</i>
to 3<i>d.</i> higher than they had been by the act of 1660. The lowest
foreign rate for a single letter, 10<i>d.</i>, was paid between London and
France, and London and the Spanish Netherlands. To Germany
and Northwestern Europe, through the Spanish Netherlands, the
rate was 12<i>d.</i>, to Italy or Sicily the same way 12<i>d.</i>, postpaid to
Antwerp, or 15<i>d.</i> via Lyons. The same rates held for letters passing
through the United Provinces. To Spain or Portugal via the
Spanish Netherlands or the United Provinces or France, postpaid
to Bayonne, the rate was 18<i>d.</i> for a single letter, and the same
price held when letters were conveyed directly by sailing packets.</p>

<p>By the same act of 1711 rates were for the first time established
between England and her colonies and within the colonies themselves.
The postage for a single letter from London to any of the
West India Islands was 18<i>d.</i>, to New York 12<i>d.</i>, and the same from
those places to London. Between the West Indies and New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144">[144]</a></span>
the rate was 4<i>d.</i> In the colonies on the mainland, the chief letter
offices were at New York, Perth Amboy, New London, Philadelphia,
Bridlington, Newport, Portsmouth, Boston, Annapolis,
Salem, Ipswich, Piscataway, Williamstown, and Charleston. The
postage was 4<i>d.</i> to and from any of these places to a distance not
exceeding sixty miles and 6<i>d.</i> for any distance between sixty and
100 miles. Between New York, Perth Amboy, and Bridlington,
the rate was 6<i>d.</i>; between New York, New London, and Philadelphia
9<i>d.</i>; between New York, Newport, Portsmouth, and Boston
12<i>d.</i>; between New York, Salem, Ipswich, Piscataway, and Williamstown
15<i>d.</i>; between New York and Charleston 18<i>d.</i>; the Post
Office was to pay nothing for crossing ferries.</p>

<p>There had always been trouble in collecting the rates on bye and
cross post letters. These letters did not pass through London and
hence the officials at the General Post Office had no check on the
money due. By a clause in the act, the postmasters were ordered
under a penalty to account for the receipts from all these letters.
The postage on letters which did not pass to, through, or from
London was fixed according to the inland charges, varying with
the distances travelled. Finally, the postage on all inland letters
was to be paid on delivery unless the sender wished to pay in advance,
or in the case of the Penny Post, or unless such letters should
be directed on board any ship or vessel or to any person in the
army.</p>

<p>From the receipts from postage, £700 a week was to be paid
into the Exchequer for the purpose of carrying on the war. The
Accountant-General was to keep account of all money raised, the
receipts themselves going directly to the Receiver-General and
being paid into the Exchequer by him. One third of the surplus
over and above the weekly payment of £700 and £111,461 (the
amount of the gross receipts of the duties arising by virtue of the
act of 1660) were to be disposed of by Parliament. In making this
provision, Joyce thinks that the Chancellor of the Exchequer confused
gross and net product.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> As a matter of fact there was no such
surplus as was anticipated by the Chancellor, but it does not follow
that he made the mistake of which he was accused by Cornwallis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145">[145]</a></span>
and Craggs, an accusation in which Joyce evidently concurs. He
erred simply in supposing that expenses would remain the same.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

of "every single letter or piece of paper" enacted that a
"double letter should pay twice that rate." The merchants contended
that a double letter was composed of two sheets of paper if
they weighed less than an ounce and their reasoning was logical.
They argued from this that a letter enclosing a pattern or patterns,
if it weighed less than one ounce, should pay only as a single letter.
Actions were brought against the postmasters by the merchants
for charging more than they considered was warranted and
the merchants won every case. The lawyers also threatened legal
proceedings for the charge of writs when enclosed in letters. The
Postmasters-General hastened to Parliament for relief. The merchants
heard of this, and petitions were sent to the House of
Commons from "clothiers, dealers in cloth, silk, and other manufactured
goods," asking that when samples were enclosed in a
single letter the rate should remain the same provided that such
letter and sample did not exceed half an ounce in weight.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Their
efforts were fruitless. The following provisions were inserted in
a tobacco bill then before Parliament and passed in 1753: "that
every writ etc. enclosed in a letter was to pay as a distinct letter
and that a letter with one or more patterns enclosed and not
exceeding one ounce in weight was to pay as a double letter."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> As
a matter of fact all the rates collected after 1743 by virtue of the
act of 1711 were illegal, for the act itself had died a natural death
in the former year by that clause which provided for the revival of
the rates of 1660 at the end of thirty-two years.</p>

<p>A postal act was passed in 1765, slightly changing the home,
colonial, and foreign rates. The cession of territory in North America
had made necessary a more comprehensive scheme of postage rates
there. The conclusion of the Seven Years' War had made it possible
to offer a slight reduction in postage. In Great Britain the following
rates were published for short distances for a single letter:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="1765 rates">
<tr>
<td class="left">For Great Britain&mdash;not exceeding one post stage</td>
<td class="right">1<i>d.</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="left">For England alone&mdash;over one and not exceeding two stages</td>
<td class="right">2<i>d.</i></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>The rates for all other distances remained unchanged. A stage, as a
rule, varied from ten to twelve miles in length, so that every post
town in England could now boast a modified form of penny
postage, with the exception in most cases of delivery facilities.</p>

<p>The changes in colonial rates were generally in the shape of substituting
general for special rules. The rate from any part of the
British American Dominions to any other part was fixed at 4<i>d.</i> for a
single letter when conveyed by sea. The act of 1711 had given the
postage from and to specially named places. This method had become
inapplicable with the growth in population among the old
and the increase in new possessions. The rate for a single letter
from any chief post office in the British American Dominions to a
distance not exceeding sixty miles, or for any distance not exceeding
sixty miles from any post office from which letters did not pass
through a chief post office, was placed at 4<i>d.</i>, from sixty to 100 miles
6<i>d.</i>, from 100 to 200 miles 8<i>d.</i>, for each additional hundred miles
2<i>d.</i> The effect of this act was to continue the same rates for inland
postage in British America, while rates were provided for distances
over 100 miles. The postage between England and the
American colonies remained at 12<i>d.</i> for a single letter. In the
case of the West Indies, there was a decrease of 6<i>d.</i> A clause of
the act provided that the postage on letters sent out of England
might be demanded in advance.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>Postage rates were increased steadily from 1784 for twenty-eight
years, culminating in the year 1812 with the highest rates that
England has ever seen. Every available means to raise the revenue
necessary to maintain her supremacy was resorted to, and the
Post Office was compelled to bear its share of the burden. In 1784
another penny was added to the rates for single letters and additional
rates for double and triple letters in proportion.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147">[147]</a></span>years later an act was passed, fixing the postage for the conveyance
of a single letter by sailing packet from Milford Haven to Waterford
at 6<i>d.</i> over and above all other rates. It was provided by the
same act that the rates between London and Ireland via Milford
should not exceed the rates via Holyhead.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>In 1796 the rates for letters conveyed within England and Wales,
Berwick, to and from Portugal, and to and from the British possessions
in America, as established by the acts of 1711, 1765, and
1784, were repealed and the following substituted for a single
letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>The old system of reckoning by stages was thus abolished, probably
on account of the uncertainty as to the length of any particular
stage and the variations and changes which were being constantly
made. This change was made for England and Wales only,
and the old system of reckoning by stages was still retained in Scotland.
Letters from and to the colonies had formerly paid no postage
over the regular shilling rate for a single letter and proportionately
for other letters. Now they were to pay the full inland
rate in addition. A single letter from the West Indies would now
pay the shilling packet rate plus the rate from Falmouth to London,
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in all. The same rates and the same rule held for letters
to and from Portugal. A single letter from Lisbon had formerly
paid 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> on delivery in London. It would now pay 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This act was not to affect letters to and from non-commissioned
officers, privates, and seamen while in active service, who were allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148">[148]</a></span>to send and receive letters for one penny each, payable in
advance. The revenue arising from the new and the unrepealed
rates was to be paid to the Receiver-General and be by him carried
to the Consolidated Fund. The increase from the additional postage
was estimated at £40,000 a year and was to be used to pay the
interest on loans contracted the preceding year.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>When sailing packets were established between Weymouth and
the islands of Jersey and Guernsey, the packet rates and the rates
between the islands themselves were fixed at 2<i>d.</i> for a single letter.
Permission was also given to establish postal routes in the islands,
and to charge the same postage for the conveyance of letters as in
England. The surplus was to go to the General Office and all postal
laws then in force in England were to be deemed applicable to the
two islands.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>By the same act which gave the Postmasters-General authority
to forward letters by vessels other than the regular sailing packets,
rates were fixed for the carriage of such letters. For every single
letter brought into the kingdom by these vessels, 4<i>d.</i> was to be
charged. The Postmasters-General might order such rates to be
payable in advance or on delivery. This was in addition to the inland
postage, and for every letter handed over to the Post Office,
the captain was to receive 2<i>d.</i> The revenue arising from this act
was payable to the Exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<p>In 1801 the Post Office was called upon again to make a further
contribution to the Exchequer to help meet the interest on new
loans. The following were the new rates for a single letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>By the act of 1796 a uniform rate of 8<i>d.</i> for a single letter had
been paid for distances over 150 miles. The new act not only imposed
extra rates for all distances over 150 miles but it decreased
the distances above 30 miles for which the old postage would have
paid. For instance, a 6<i>d.</i> rate had carried a single letter 100 miles,
a 7<i>d.</i> rate 150 miles. They now carried only 80 and 120 miles respectively.</p>

<p>On letters to and from places abroad, "not being within His
Majesty's Dominions," an additional rate of 4<i>d.</i> for a single letter
was imposed.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> In London, where a penny had been charged for the
conveyance of letters by the Penny Post, 2<i>d.</i> was now charged. An
additional rate of 2<i>d.</i> for a single letter was imposed upon letters
passing between Great Britain and Ireland via Holyhead or Milford.
The Postmasters-General were given authority to convey
letters to and from places which were not post towns for such
sums for extra service as might be agreed upon. Merchants' accounts
and bills of exchange which, when sent out of the kingdom
or conveyed into it, had not formerly been charged postage over
the letters in which they were enclosed, were now to be rated as
letters.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p>The postage on letters arriving in Ireland for the distance travelled
outside Ireland was ordered to be collected by the Irish Postmaster-General
and forwarded to London. An additional penny was imposed
upon Dublin Penny Post letters crossing the circular road
around Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>In 1805, for the third time within ten years, the Exchequer fell
back upon the Post Office for an increase of revenue estimated at
£230,000.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> There were added to the rates as already prescribed&mdash;1<i>d.</i>
for a single letter, 2<i>d.</i> for a double letter, 3<i>d.</i> for a triple letter,
and 4<i>d.</i> for a letter weighing as much as one ounce, for all letters
conveyed by the Post in Great Britain or between Great Britain
and Ireland. The postage on a single letter from London to Brighton
was thus raised from 6<i>d.</i> to 7<i>d.</i>, from London to Liverpool
from 9<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i>, and from London to Edinburgh from 12<i>d.</i> to 13<i>d.</i>
Twopenny Post letters paid 3<i>d.</i> if sent beyond the General Post
Delivery limits, while newspapers paid 1<i>d.</i> On every letter passing
between Great Britain and a foreign country 2<i>d.</i> more was to be
paid. An additional penny was charged for every single letter
between Great Britain and the British American Dominions via
Portugal, and between Great Britain, the Isle of Man and Jersey
and Guernsey.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> In the same year the Irish rates were also increased
by the imposition of an additional penny upon each single letter
with corresponding changes in the postage on double and triple
letters. The Dublin Penny Post was left untouched, its boundaries
being defined as contained within a circle of four miles radius, with
the General Post Office building as the centre. Every letter from
any ship within Irish waters was charged a penny in addition to the
increased rates.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>Still the demand was for more money to help replenish an exhausted
treasury. An additional penny was added for the conveyance
of a single letter more than twenty miles beyond the place
where the letter was posted within Great Britain and between Great
Britain and Ireland. For the conveyance of a single letter between
Great Britain and any of the colonies or to any foreign country an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151">[151]</a></span>additional 2<i>d.</i> was required. These additional rates did not apply
to letters to and from Jersey or Guernsey, or to and from any non-commissioned
officer, soldier, or sailor.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> Samples weighing no more
than one ounce were to pay 2<i>d.</i> if enclosed in a letter, if not enclosed,
1<i>d.</i> As this is the highest point to which postage rates in England
have ever attained, it may be interesting to give the rates resulting
from this act in tabular form as far as the postage for
inland single letters was concerned.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

miles, higher for distances over eighty miles. On the whole there
was little change, but the later rates were probably more easily
borne as they were lower for short distances.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
The next year the rates and distances for Ireland were changed again, the result being
an increase both for short and for long distances. The results are
shown in the following table in Irish miles and Irish currency and
for a single letter:<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1813 an additional half-penny was demanded on all Scotch letters "because the
mail coaches now paid toll in that country." So at least a correspondent to the <i>Times</i>
says (London <i>Times</i>, 1813, June 21, p. 3).</p>

<p>In 1814 the postage on a single letter brought into the kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153">[153]</a></span>by ships other than the regular packets was raised from 4<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>
in addition to the regular inland rates. The rate for letters sent out
of the kingdom by these vessels was fixed at one third the regular
packet rates.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> An exception was made in the case of letters carried
by war vessels or by vessels of the East India Company to and from
the Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, and that part of the East Indies
embraced in the charter of the company. The rates by these vessels
were to be the same as the regular packet rates, 42<i>d.</i> for a single
letter between those places and England, and 21<i>d.</i> for a single letter
between the places themselves. Newspapers were charged 3<i>d.</i> an
ounce between England, the Cape, Mauritius, and the East Indies.
The rate for a single letter conveyed in private vessels not employed
by the Post Office to carry mails was 14<i>d.</i> from England to
the Cape or the East Indies, and 8<i>d.</i> from the Cape or the East
Indies to England. The company was allowed to collect rates on
letters within its own territory in India, but the Postmasters-General
of England might at any time establish post offices in any such
territory. The company was to be paid for the use of its ships in
conveying letters.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>By the Ship Letter Act of 1814, no letters were to be sent by private
ships except such as had been brought to the Post Office to be
charged. The directors of the East India Company had protested
against this section of the act. It is true that they were allowed to
send and receive letters by the ships of their own company, but in
India there was a small army of officials in their service whose letters
had hitherto gone free. For that matter it had been the custom
for the company to carry for nothing all letters and papers which
were placed in the letter box at the East India House.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Petitions
were presented against an attempt on the part of the Post Office to
charge postage on letters to and from India when conveyed by
private vessels.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> The company refused to allow its vessels to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154">[154]</a></span>used as packet boats or even to carry letters at all. It was in consequence
of all this opposition that the act of 1815 was passed, giving
more favourable treatment to letters to and from India. By this
act no person sending a letter to India was compelled to have it
charged at the Post Office and the masters were compelled to carry
letters if the Postmasters-General ordered them. The company
now withdrew all opposition and even refused to accept any payment
for the use of their vessels in conveying letters.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Notwithstanding
the favourable exception made in the case of letters to and
from the East Indies, there was still discontent over the high rates
charged by the Post Office for the conveyance of letters by the regular
packet boats and by private vessels, when carrying letters entrusted
to the Post Office.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> In 1819 the sea postage on any letter
or package not exceeding three ounces in weight from Ceylon,
Mauritius, the Cape, and the East Indies was placed at 4<i>d.</i> If it
exceeded three ounces in weight, it was charged 12<i>d.</i> an ounce. The
sea postage on letters and packages to Ceylon, etc., not exceeding
three ounces in weight, was placed at 2<i>d.</i> If the weight was more
than three ounces, the charge was 12<i>d.</i> an ounce. The postage
on letters and packages from England was payable in advance.
Newspapers were charged a penny an ounce.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>By an act passed in 1827 it was provided that henceforth all
rates for letters conveyed within Ireland should be collected in
British currency. The rates themselves and the distances remained
the same as had been provided by the act of 1814. The postage
collected on letters between the two kingdoms was henceforth to be
retained in the country where it was collected. The rates for letters
passing between the two kingdoms were assimilated with the rates
prescribed for Great Britain by the act of 1812. In addition to the
land rates, 2d. was required for the sea passage to and from Holyhead
and Milford and to this 2<i>d.</i> more was added for the use of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155">[155]</a></span>Conway and Menai Bridges.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Between Portpatrick and Donaghadee
the postage was 4<i>d.</i> for a single letter, between Liverpool and
any Irish port 8<i>d.</i>, but no letter sent via Liverpool paid a higher
rate than if sent via Holyhead.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> An additional halfpenny was also
demanded on every single letter passing between Milford Haven
and Waterford, to pay for improvements.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>


<p>In 1836, England and France signed a postal treaty by which
the rates on letters between the United Kingdom and France or
between any other country and the United Kingdom through
France were materially reduced.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> On such letters the method of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156">[156]</a></span>reckoning postage differed from the English rule and was as follows:
One sheet of paper not exceeding an ounce in weight and every
letter not exceeding one quarter of an ounce were single letters.
Every letter with one enclosure only and not exceeding an ounce
in weight was a double letter. Every letter containing more than
one enclosure and not exceeding half an ounce was a double letter.
If it exceeded half an ounce but not an ounce in weight, it was a
triple letter. If it exceeded an ounce, it paid as four single letters
and for every quarter of an ounce above one ounce it paid an additional
single letter rate.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> The sender of a letter from Great Britain
to France had the option of prepaying the whole postage, British
and foreign, or the British alone, or neither.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>In 1837, an act of Parliament was passed, consolidating previous
acts for the regulation of postage rates within Great Britain and
Ireland, between Great Britain and Ireland, and between the United
Kingdom and the colonies and foreign countries. The rates within
Great Britain remained the same as those established by the act
of 1812, including the additional half penny on letters conveyed by
mail coaches in Scotland. In Ireland the rates existing since 1814
still held and between Great Britain and Ireland the rates established
by 7 and 8 Geo. IV, c. 21.</p>

<p>The rates for letters between the United Kingdom and foreign
countries through France and those conveyed directly between the
United Kingdom and France remained the same as had been agreed
upon by the Treaty of 1836. Some of the more important of the
other rates were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>To Italy, Sicily, Venetian Lombardy, Malta, the Ionian Islands,
Greece, Turkey, the Levant, the Archipelago, Syria, and Egypt
through Belgium, Holland, or Germany, 20<i>d.</i> for a single letter.
Between the United Kingdom and Portugal, 19<i>d.</i> for a single letter.

<p>Letters between the United Kingdom and Germany, Belgium,
Holland, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, and Norway were charged in
addition the same postage as if they had been sent from or to London.
Letters from and to France paid no additional postage. All
letters to and from non-commissioned officers, privates and seamen
while in actual service were still carried for one penny each, payable
in advance, but letters sent by them from Ceylon, the East Indies,

in 1837, the Postmaster-General was authorized to charge regular

<p>The end of high postage rates was now at hand. In 1839, the

weight of the letter or package,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> and they proceeded to do so in

Canaries.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Parliament followed up the good work in 1840 by

<p>For every ounce above four ounces, two additional rates of postage,
and for every fraction of an ounce above four ounces as for one
additional ounce. No letter or package exceeding one pound in
weight was to be sent through the Post Office except petitions and
addresses to the Queen, or to either House of Parliament, or in such
cases as the Treasury Lords might order by warrant.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

the Post between places in the United Kingdom (not being letters
sent to or from places beyond the seas, or posted in any post town

of one penny. For all letters exceeding a half-ounce in weight, additional

<p>The rates for colonial letters were also adjusted according to
weight as follows: Between any place in the United Kingdom
and any port in the colonies and India (except when passing
through France) for a letter not exceeding half an ounce in weight,
1<i>s.</i> Between any of the colonies through the United Kingdom, 2<i>s.</i>
If such letters exceeded half an ounce in weight, they were charged
additional rates according to the table already given, the rate for a
letter not exceeding half an ounce being taken as the basis.</p>

<p>The rates for letters to and from foreign countries were much
the same as they had been before the passage of this act, except
that instead of the initial charge being made for a single letter, it
was now reckoned for a letter not exceeding half an ounce in weight.
The rates for letters to and from France were graded according to the
distance they were carried in England, the lowest rate for a letter
not more than half an ounce in weight being 3<i>d.</i> to Dover or the
port of arrival, the highest rate being 10<i>d.</i> to any place distant
more than fifty miles from Dover.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>The franking privilege may reasonably be considered in connection
with the history of postal rates, nor should its effect in reducing
the revenue of the Post Office be neglected. The Council of State
gave orders in 1652 that all public packets, letters of members of
Parliament, of the Council, of officers in the public service, and of
any persons acting in a public capacity should be carried free. This
is the first record that we have concerning the free carriage of
members' letters, a privilege which later gave so much trouble and
was so much abused.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> The next year the Post Office farmers agreed
to carry free all letters to and from members of Parliament provided
<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>that letters written by such members as were not known by
their seals should be endorsed, "These are for the service of the
Commonwealth," and signed by the members themselves or their
clerks.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> Nothing was said in the act of 1660 about the conveyance
of the letters of members of Parliament and they were carried free
only by act of grace. The House of Commons had passed a clause
of the bill providing for the free conveyance of the letters of members
of their own House. This had exasperated the Lords, who,
since they could not amend the clause so as to extend the privilege
to themselves, had dropped it.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> In 1693, the attention of Cotton
and Frankland was called to the manner in which franking was
being abused. Men claimed the right to frank letters to whom the
Postmasters-General denied it, and members of Parliament were
accused of bad faith in the exercise of their privilege. The custom
had arisen of enclosing private letters in the packet of official letters.
A warrant was issued in 1693 to the effect that in future no
letters were to go free except those on the King's affairs, and the
only persons to send or receive them free were the two principal
Secretaries of State, the Secretary for Scotland, the Secretary in
Holland, the Earl of Portland, and members of Parliament, the
latter only during the session, and for forty days before and after,
and for inland letters alone. Each member was to write his name
in a book with his seal so that no one might be able to counterfeit
his signature.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>We learn from Hicks' letters that it was customary for clerks in
the Post Office at London to send gazettes to their correspondents
in the country free of charge. These gazettes or news letters were
supplied by the Treasury and, as 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> apiece was paid for them
by the recipients, the privilege was greatly esteemed.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> The Deputy
Postmaster-General wished to abolish the privilege, but Hicks
himself, who was one of the favoured officials, was quite indignant
at the suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> The principle was bad, but as the receipts for
gazettes formed a necessary part of the clerks' salaries, Hicks cannot
<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>be blamed for protesting against abolition without compensation.
James II expressed a desire that the practice should be discontinued,
but when it was shown to him that the salaries of the clerks
must be raised if his wishes were obeyed, his proposition was

<p>The abuses of the privilege of franking were very pronounced
during the eighteenth century. The system of patronage which the
members of Parliament then exercised made them reluctant to
offend any of their constituents, who might entrench upon their
peculiar privileges. Members' names were forged to letters and
they made no complaint. Letters from the country were sent to
them to be re-addressed under their own signatures. The Postmasters-General
admonished them more than once, but, as a rule, the
members disclaimed all knowledge of abuses. Men were so bold as
to order letters to be sent under a member's name to coffee-houses,
where they presented themselves and demanded the letters so addressed.
In 1715, on receiving renewed complaints from the Postmasters-General,
it was ordered by the House that henceforth no
member should frank a letter unless the address were written entirely
in his own hand. This was expected to prevent members from
franking letters sent to them by friends. It was also ordered that no
letter addressed to a member should pass free unless such member
was actually residing at the place to which the letter was addressed.
In the third place, no member was to frank a newspaper unless
it was entirely in print. This was to prevent the franking of long
written communications passing as newspapers, for the members of
Parliament in sending and receiving letters free were restricted to
such as did not exceed two ounces in weight, but they were not so
restricted in the case of newspapers.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> According to the Surveyor's
report, the loss from the ministers' franks in 1717 was £8270 and
from the members' franks £17,470.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The loss from franking was
proportionately much greater in Ireland than in England. In 1718
the Irish Parliament sat only three months, in 1719 nine months,
and in Ireland as in England, members of Parliament received and
sent their letters free only during the session and forty days before
<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>and after it. The following is part of the report submitted by the
Postmasters-General to the Lords of the Treasury for these two
years:&mdash;</p>

<p>Under the charges of management is included the charge for carrying
members' letters as reckoned proportionately to the charge for the
letters which paid, together with the actual charge for the pay letters.
The net produce during the three months' session was £3006, during
the nine months' session only £753. In 1734 the old orders about
the maximum weight of two ounces and the requirement for the
whole superscription to be in the member's own writing were repeated
in a royal proclamation. In addition it was ordered that
any letters sent under cover to any member of Parliament or high
official of state, to be forwarded by him, should be sent to the General
Post Office to be taxed.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> It could hardly be expected that this
order would be obeyed, for there was no method of enforcing it.</p>

<p>In 1735, the House of Commons instituted an enquiry into
the whole question of franking and summoned various Post Office
officials before them to give evidence. An estimate was laid before
them of the amount lost each year by carrying franked letters.
This estimate was obtained by weighing the franked letters
at intervals during the session of Parliament, and comparing
their weight with the weight of the letters which paid postage. As
the total revenue from the latter was known, the amount which
was lost on the former was guessed. The House expressed very little
confidence in the estimated amounts, and certainly it was a rough
way of attaining the object aimed at, but perhaps they were prejudiced
from the strength of the case against them.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Expressed in
yearly averages, the amounts by which the revenue was reduced by
franking were:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>
<p>The system of ascertaining forged franks and of discovering enclosures
was as follows: a Supervisor of the Franks charged all
letters, franked by a member's name, coming from any place, when
he knew that the member was not there. Very often by holding
them in front of a candle, he could see enclosures inside directed to
other people. If he was in doubt he generally charged the letter, for
if it should pay, all well and good, and if he had made a mistake, the
amount was refunded to the member. The Supervisor had noticed
that the number of franked letters had increased with every session
of Parliament, and some of the ex-members also attempted to frank
letters. The evidence of the Supervisor, especially his description
of the manner in which he attempted to discover enclosures, was
exceedingly distasteful to the House. The members themselves
were to blame for many of the abuses attendant upon the system,
and yet they contended that they were the unwilling victims of
others. A resolution was adopted that it was an infringement upon
the privileges of the knights, citizens, and burgesses chosen to represent
the people of Great Britain in Parliament, for any postmaster,
his deputies or agents to open or look into any letter
addressed to or signed by a member of Parliament, unless empowered
so to do by a warrant issued by one of the Secretaries
of State. In addition no postmaster or his deputies should
delay or detain any letter directed to or by any member unless
there should be good reason to suppose that the frank was a counterfeit.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>The restrictions adopted to curtail the abuse of the franking
privilege had but little effect. A regular business sprang up for
selling counterfeit franks. The House of Lords ordered one person
accused of selling them to come before the bar of the House for
examination, but he failed to present himself.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Another confessed
before the Upper House that he had counterfeited one of the Lords'
names on certain covers of letters showed to him and had then sold
them. He expressed sorrow for the offence, which necessity had
driven him to commit. He was sent to Newgate.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> The abuses of the
<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>franking system were so patent<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> that Allen was told that he might
withdraw from his contract to farm the bye and cross post letters
on three months' notice being given.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>The revenue from the Post Office was surrendered by the Crown
at the beginning of George the Third's reign in exchange for a Civil
List from the Aggregate Fund as it was then called.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> While the
Post Office remained in the hands of the King, it was only by special
grant on his part that the members of Parliament had been allowed
to send and receive letters free. Accordingly in 1763, an act was
passed for the purpose of giving parliamentary sanction to the
privilege. This act repeated the principal points in the King's
proclamation and in the Parliament's previous resolutions on the
subject. All letters or packets sent to or by the King, the ministers
and the higher Post Office officials were to go free. The ministers
might appoint others to frank their letters, whose names must be
forwarded to the Postmaster-General. Those sending letters free
must sign their names on the outside and themselves write the address.
No letters to or from any member of Parliament should go
free unless they were sent during the session or within forty days before
or after, and the whole superscription must be in the member's
own hand or directed to him at his usual place of residence or at
the House. All letters in excess of two ounces in weight must pay
postage. Printed votes, proceedings in Parliament, and newspapers
should go free when sent to a member or signed on the outside by
him, provided they were sent without covers or with covers open
at the ends. The privileges of franking votes, proceedings in Parliament,
and newspapers, were continued to the clerks in the Post
Office and in the Secretaries of State's offices. The Postmasters-General
and their deputies were given authority to search newspapers
which had no covers or covers open at the ends and to
charge them if there were writing or enclosures in them. Finally,
any person who counterfeited a member's name on any letter or
<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>package for the purpose of avoiding the payment of postage, was
guilty of felony and liable to transportation for seven years.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>The year following the passing of this act, the House of Commons
called for returns relating to the franking system. Besides the
members of Parliament, the ministers, and the Post Office officials,
to whom the franking privilege had been granted by the King's
warrant and by the late act, almost all who were in any way connected
with the Government claimed the right to send or receive
letters free, even to the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms. The amount
which newspapers would have paid if there had been no franking
privilege was first given for the week ending March 13, 1764.</p>

<p>These amounts were obtained by weighing the newspapers and, as
this was the manner in which they would have been rated, the results
may be considered as fairly correct. The idea being to estimate
the loss from members' and states' franks only, the franking
by Post Office clerks does not enter into the following calculation.
It was judged from the figures given above that the Post Office
carried free every year enough newspapers franked by members
and state officials to produce £40,000 if they had been taxed at the
ordinary rates.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> An attempt to arrive at the same result in another
way was also made. The sum total which would have been paid
on all members' and ministers' letters, newspapers, and parcels
arriving at or departing from London in 1763 was £140,000. Of
this amount £85,000 would have been paid on all mail leaving
London, and £55,000 on all mail arriving in London. The difference
in favour of the outgoing mail was judged to be due to the newspapers,
all of which were printed in London and sent to the country.
This would give a loss of £30,000 on newspapers, and £110,000 on
letters.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>Returns were also submitted, showing the gross amount of the
inland postage for Great Britain and Ireland, including the amount
which the franked letters and papers would have paid if they had
all been charged, the actual gross product and the difference between
<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>the two. This difference would, of course, be the estimated
charge on all the free matter. These figures are given from 1715
to 1763. Roughly speaking, in fifty years franked letters and
papers increased 700 per cent while pay letters increased only
50 per cent. In 1715 one fifth as many free letters and newspapers
as those which paid went through the mail. In 1763 there were
eleven twelfths as many free letters and papers.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> It will be seen
that the assumption is that the postage which this free matter
might have paid represented the loss suffered by the Post Office.
Now this is not so, because it did not cost the Post Office so much
to convey letters and papers as the ordinary rates would have paid
them. In the second place the Postal authorities considered the
£140,000 as so much actually lost, whereas if charges had been
enforced on the free matter, a much smaller amount would have
been sent. This is entirely apart from the rough and ready manner
in which the figures were obtained. Enough was shown, however,
to prove that the franking system was a burden to the country and
an imposition upon the Post Office.</p>

<p>In Ireland, Parliament met as a rule only during the even years
or if it met every year, the sessions in the odd years were very
short. For the five even years from 1753 to 1762, the expenses
averaged for each year £3306 over the receipts, while during the
five odd years, the receipts were greater than the expenditures by a
yearly average of £2249. These general results held good for every
individual odd or even year for the period for which returns were
given.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

<p>Attempts continued to be made by members of the House of
Commons to diminish the abuses arising from franking. There had
been some misunderstanding as to whether they were entitled to
have ship's letters delivered free to them. Of course they were exempt
from the inland postage on such letters, but for every letter
brought into the country by vessels other than packets, the master
was paid one penny and this penny was collected from the person
to whom the letter was delivered. The members finally agreed to
pay the extra penny.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p>Acts were now introduced to enable the Commander-in-Chief,
<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>the Adjutant-General, and the Controller of Accounts of the Royal
forces to receive and send letters free. Both bills passed.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> It is
some consolation that the Lord Chancellor and Judges failed to
obtain the franking privilege although a bill was introduced in the
Commons in their behalf.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>It was enacted in 1784 that a member must write on his free letters
not only his name and address but also the name of the post
town from which they were to be sent and the day of the month
and the year when they were posted.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> The object of this restriction
could be easily evaded by enclosing postdated letters to their constituents
but, after the passage of this resolution, a considerable
decrease resulted in the number of free letters to and from members.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
When the Irish was separated from the English Post Office, the
privilege of franking newspapers to Ireland was taken away and a
rate of one penny a newspaper was imposed, payable in advance.
This meant a loss to the clerks in the Secretaries' offices but this
was made good to them by an addition of £1000 a year to their
salaries.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>In 1795, the members of Parliament made another attempt to
limit their own as well as the free writing proclivities of others. The
maximum weight of a free letter to or from a member was lowered
from two ounces to one. No letter directed by a member should go
free unless the member so directing it should be within twenty
miles of the place where it was posted either on the day on which
it was posted or the day before. No member should send more
than ten or receive more than fifteen free letters a day. Votes and
proceedings in Parliament when addressed to or by members of
Parliament were exempted from the provisions of this Act.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>
<p>The restrictions upon the franking privilege enjoyed by members
of Parliament were re-enacted in 1802 with some additions. The
number of free letters which a member might receive and send
in one day having been limited to twenty-five, it was decided that
these twenty-five so excepted from the payment of postage should
be those on which the charges were the highest, provided that none
of them exceeded an ounce in weight. The high officials of state,
the clerks of Parliament, certain clerks of the Commons and Lords,
the Treasurer and Paymaster of the Navy, the Lord Chancellor,
certain officials in Ireland, and two persons appointed by the Postmaster-General
of Ireland were allowed to send letters free.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> The
members and clerks of both Houses were allowed to send newspapers
free provided that they were enclosed in covers open at both
ends. The same rule held for votes and proceedings in Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>
The same franking privileges were extended to Irish officials.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<p>From 1806 to 1819 there was a large extension of the franking
privilege to various officials. During that time sixteen statutes and
parts of statutes were enacted in behalf of various persons from
the Lord High Chancellor to the Controller of the Barrack's Department
and the Commissioners of the parliamentary grant for
building churches. Sir Robert Buxton, a member of Parliament,
thought that it would be well for his fellow members to give up
their privilege in order to help the finances of the country. Windham
disagreed on the ground that it kept up communications
between a member and his constituents and encouraged literary
correspondence which would otherwise decline. Pitt justified it, in
that it enabled members to carry on the important business of their
constituents and did not result in much loss to the state.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>
<p>It had always been customary to charge letter rates for the conveyance
of newspapers to foreign countries and to the colonies.
Members of Parliament, however, had the privilege of franking
newspapers within the United Kingdom, the clerks of the Foreign
Office franked them to foreign countries, and the Secretary of the
Post Office franked them to the colonies. In 1825 it was enacted
that members need no longer sign their names to newspapers
franked by them, or give notice of the names of the places to which
they intended to send them.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> This virtually provided for the free
transmission of newspapers within the United Kingdom. At the
same time it was provided that the rate for newspapers, votes and
parliamentary proceedings should be 1&#189;<i>d.</i> each to the colonies,
payable in advance. Newspapers from the colonies were charged
3<i>d.</i> each, payable on delivery. Such newspapers must be posted on
the day of publication, must contain no writing, and must be enclosed
in covers open at both ends.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Two years later the charge for
votes and parliamentary proceedings to and from the colonies was
fixed at 1&#189;<i>d.</i> an ounce. Newspapers brought from the colonies by
private vessels were to be charged 3<i>d.</i> each, the same as the packet
rate,<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> but in 1835 colonial newspapers by private vessels were allowed
to come in for a penny each, and the same rate was charged
for English newspapers sent to the colonies by private vessels. By
the same act the postage on newspapers passing between the United
Kingdom and any foreign country which charged no inland rate for
their conveyance was fixed at a penny each. If an inland rate was
charged, the postage was to be 2<i>d.</i> for each newspaper plus the foreign
rate.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>During the following year, all the regulations concerning the conveyance
of newspapers, votes, and proceedings in Parliament etc.
were embodied in one act. Within the United Kingdom all newspapers
which had paid the stamp duty were to go free except those
which were sent through the Twopenny Post and delivered by it,
<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>not having passed by the General Post, and except those posted
and delivered within the same town. In both of these cases one
penny was charged. To and from the colonies no rate was demanded
when newspapers were sent by the regular packets. If
sent by private vessels one penny was payable, which went to the
master. The rate to and from foreign countries was fixed at 2<i>d.</i> for
each paper, but if a foreign state agreed to charge no postage on
English newspapers, no postage should be charged on the newspapers
of such foreign state, when brought to England by the packet
boats. If brought by private vessels, a penny was payable for each
paper, to go to the master. All newspapers, in order to receive the
advantage of these low rates or to go free, had to be posted within
seven days after publication and to contain no writing except the
name and address of the person to whom they were to be sent. In
addition the newspaper must have no cover or one open at both
ends.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p>The following additions and changes in the regulations for the
carriage of newspapers were made in 1837. One penny was to be
paid for their conveyance by private vessels between different
parts of the United Kingdom. Between the colonies and foreign
countries through the United Kingdom, newspapers should go free
if conveyed by the packets and should pay a penny each if conveyed
by private vessels. Parliamentary proceedings conveyed between
the colonies and the United Kingdom, if sent by packet boats
and not exceeding one ounce in weight, were charged 1&#189;<i>d.</i> each.
When in excess of one ounce they paid 1&#189;<i>d.</i> for each additional
ounce. Pamphlets, magazines and other periodical publications
for the colonies, if not exceeding six ounces in weight, paid 12<i>d.</i>
when carried by the packets. For every additional ounce, 3<i>d.</i> was
charged. Bankers' re-issuable notes were carried at one quarter
the regular postage.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> Patterns, with no writing enclosed and not
exceeding one ounce in weight, paid a single letter rate.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> Any newspaper
which had been posted in violation of any regulation for the
<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>conveyance of newspapers was charged three times the regular letter
postage.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>Franking and the privilege of sending and receiving letters free
from postage did not at any time extend to letters liable to foreign
postage except in the case of public despatches to and from the
Secretaries of State and British Ambassadors.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> The owners, charterers
and consignees of vessels inward bound were allowed to receive
letters free from sea postage to the maximum of six ounces
for each man, but in the case of ships coming from the East Indies,
Ceylon, Mauritius, and the Cape, the maximum was twenty
ounces.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Within the kingdom, writs for the election of members of
the House of Commons and for those Scotch and Irish peers who
were elected, were allowed to go free.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> All persons who were allowed
to frank letters within the Kingdom were grouped in ten
classes. Members of Parliament were placed in the first class and
their letters were subject to the old restrictions as to number,<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
superscription, name of post town, date, and place of residence.
They might also receive petitions free, provided that each did not
exceed six ounces in weight. They might send free printed votes and
proceedings in Parliament.</p>

<p>Officials of both Houses of Parliament were in the second class.
They were subject to the same restrictions as the first class, except
that the number of their letters was not limited and each letter
might weigh two ounces.</p>

<p>The third class was composed of members of the Treasury Department
and the Postmaster-General and his secretaries. Their
franking privilege was unlimited as to the weight and number of
letters nor were they required to insert the name of the post town
or the date.</p>

<p>The fourth class, composed of heads of departments, might send
and receive letters with no limit as to number or weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172">[172]</a></span></p><p>The fifth class, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the Irish Surveyors,
had unlimited franking rights within Ireland. All the letters
of these five classes were subject to the following restrictions with
the exception of the third class. The whole superscription of the
letters sent must be in the hand of the privileged person, with his
name and the name of the post town from which the letters were
sent together with the date, and on that date or the day before, the
writer must be within twenty miles of the place where the letters
were posted.</p>

<p>The other five classes were made up of subordinate members of
departments, clerks, secretaries etc. when writing or receiving letters
on official business. Every such letter had to be superscribed with
the name of the office and the seal and name of the writer.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>It appeared from a report of a committee appointed to investigate
postal affairs that the total number of franks had increased
from 3,039,000 in 1810 to 4,142,000 in 1820; 4,792,000 in 1830 and
5,270,000 in 1837. Of these, members of the two Houses were
responsible for 2,028,000; 2,726,000; 2,814,000 and 3,084,000 at the
above dates respectively.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> In concluding their report the Committee
recommended the abolition of Parliamentary franking.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> This
advice was followed and improved upon two years later when
franking and the privilege of sending or receiving letters free were
abolished, except in the case of petitions to the Queen or Parliament
not exceeding 32 ounces in weight.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>No further reduction in inland postage rates was adopted until
the net revenue of the Post Office had pretty well recovered from
the blow received by the adoption of penny postage.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Such reduction
was finally granted in 1865, applying only to letters weighing
more than one ounce each, the increases in weight being graduated
by half ounces with a penny for each additional half ounce instead
of 2<i>d.</i> for each additional ounce as before. Corresponding reductions<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173">[173]</a></span>
were made at the same time in the book post and the pattern
and sample post, and were made applicable to correspondence with
British North America and the British possessions in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> In
1870, when the impressed newspaper stamp was finally abolished,
the rate on prepaid newspapers was reduced to a halfpenny each
whether sent singly or in packages, but no package was to be charged
higher than the book post rate. Unpaid newspapers were charged a
penny for each two ounces or fraction thereof. The book post rate
was reduced at the same time to a halfpenny for each two ounces
or fraction thereof. The rate for patterns and samples, which had
formerly been 2<i>d.</i> for the initial four ounces, was altered to the existing
book post rate with a maximum of twelve ounces only. In 1871
the inland letter rate was fixed at a penny for the initial ounce, a
halfpenny for the next ounce and for each additional two ounces,
and the sample and pattern post was incorporated with the inland
letter post. A separate sample and pattern post was reëstablished
in 1887, only to be incorporated for a second time with the letter
post ten years later.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> An additional charge for re-directed letters
was made when the re-direction necessitated a change from the original
delivery, but the charge was such only as they would be liable
to if prepaid. An exception was made in the case of letters re-directed
to sailors or soldiers, no additional charge being then made,
provided that the rate was not a foreign one. This privilege was
later extended to commissioned officers and the exemption extended
to foreign rates as well.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> In 1891 all charges for the re-direction
of letters were abolished, followed three years later by a
like abolition in the case of all other postal matter, and in 1900 the
charge for notice of removal and re-direction after the first year
was reduced from £1 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> for the second and third and 5<i>s.</i> for
subsequent years.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>With an increase in the number of valuable articles carried by
post and better arrangements for their safe keeping, it was found
possible to reduce the registration fee from 11<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>, then to 4<i>d.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174">[174]</a></span>and eventually to 2<i>d.</i> At the time of the first reduction, a rule was
issued for the compulsory registration by the Post Office of all
letters unquestionably containing coin, for the sake of letter carriers
and others rather than the protection of the public. The Post
Office did not at the time of the first reduction hold itself responsible
for the full value of the contents of a lost registered letter but
was accustomed to remunerate the sender where the contents were
proved, were of moderate amount, and the fault clearly lay with
the Post Office. In 1878 it agreed to make good up to £2 the value
of the contents of any registered letter which it lost, stipulating in
the case of money that it had been sent securely and in one of
its own envelopes. Compulsory registration by the Post Office was
also extended to include uncrossed cheques and postal orders to
which the name of the payee had not been appended.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p>An inland parcel post was not established in England until 1883.
An initial rate of 3<i>d.</i> was imposed for the first pound, increasing by
increments of 3<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> for the seventh pound. Later the maximum
weight was increased to 11 pounds, the maximum charge to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In 1905 a further reduction followed on parcels weighing
more than four pounds.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>The use of postcards was first permitted in England in 1870, a
charge of a halfpenny a dozen being made in addition to the stamp.
In 1875 this additional charge was increased to a penny a dozen
for thin cards, 2<i>d.</i> for stout cards. In 1899 these prices were reduced
to a penny for ten stout cards, a halfpenny for ten thin ones,
and the latter began rapidly to displace the former. Private post
cards were first allowed to pass through the post in 1894 for a halfpenny
each, and two years later the charge on unpaid inland post
cards was reduced from 2<i>d.</i> to a penny.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> At the same time that
the use of post cards was allowed, a half penny post was introduced
for certain classes of formal printed documents.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>In 1884 the scale of postage applicable to inland letters between
two and twelve ounces in weight was continued without limit. The
resulting rates were as follows: for the first ounce, one penny;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175">[175]</a></span>
for two ounces, 1&#189;<i>d.</i>; for all greater weights, a halfpenny for
every two ounces plus an initial penny. On the occasion of the sixtieth
anniversary of the late Queen's accession to the throne, further
decreases were announced in the postage on inland letters. The
weight carried by the initial penny was extended from one to
four ounces, the postage for heavier letters increasing as before at
the rate of a halfpenny for each additional two ounces.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>The decrease in postage for inland matter was accompanied by
lower rates for colonial and foreign letters. Although the proposal
of the Marquis of Clanricarde to establish a definite shilling<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> rate
for all colonial letters was not immediately adopted, it was not long
before even lower rates were accepted. The Marquis' plan was
communicated to the Treasury Lords in 1850 purely on Imperial
grounds, "to strengthen the ties between the colonies and the
mother country." Rates other than those on letters were even then
far from excessive. Newspapers, for instance, often passed free or
they were charged a penny each either in England or the colony,
but not in both. Parliamentary proceedings paid but one penny,
sometimes 2<i>d.</i> per quarter-pound, books 6<i>d.</i> per half-pound. A few
years later a 6<i>d.</i> letter rate was adopted for all parts of the Empire
except India, the Cape, Mauritius, and Van Diemen's Land. In
1857 the 6<i>d.</i> rate per half-ounce was extended to all the colonies and
in 1868 to the United States. In the following year this rate was
lowered to 3<i>d.</i> for letters to the United States, Canada and Prince
Edward Island.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> In 1890 this rate in the case of most of the
colonies, and some foreign countries, was still further reduced
to 2&#189;<i>d.</i>, partly no doubt on account of the crusade which Mr.
Heaton had undertaken for penny postage within the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> In
1898 his penny aspirations were realized for all the important colonies
with the exception of the Australasian and South African, and
in 1905 these too fell into line and were joined by Egypt and the
Soudan.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> In 1907, the experiment was tried of charging the comparatively
nominal sum of one penny a pound on British newspapers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176">[176]</a></span>magazines, and trade journals for Canada, duly registered for the
purpose, when sent by direct Canadian packet. This rate is less
than the cost but the loss is diminished by the fact that the Dominion
Government relieves the British Post Office of the whole cost
of ocean transit by the Canadian subsidized lines.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>In 1863 arrangements were made with the principal European
countries for a marked reduction in letter postage rates. With
France a rate of 8<i>d.</i> or 10<i>d.</i> for a quarter of an ounce, according to
the country in which the postage was paid, had existed. This was
reduced to 4<i>d.</i> payable in either country. With Italy and Spain the
existing rates of 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> and 10<i>d.</i> respectively for a quarter of an
ounce were reduced to 6<i>d.</i> The Belgian sixpenny half-ounce rate
was made 4<i>d.</i>, and with the German Postal Union the rate was
reduced from 8<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> for a half-ounce letter. In general these
were prepaid rates.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> The first Postal Union meeting at Berne in 1874
reduced still further the old rates and simplified the rules for the settlement
of postal payments between the subscribing nations. A
uniform rate for prepaid letters of 2&#189;<i>d.</i> the half ounce was agreed
to, 5<i>d.</i> for an unpaid letter. Post cards were charged at half the
rate of a prepaid letter, newspapers a penny for four ounces,
printed papers (other than newspapers), books, legal and commercial
documents, and samples of merchandise a penny for two ounces.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
In 1891 the uniform letter rate existing among those countries in
Europe which were members of the Postal Union was extended, so
far as the United Kingdom was concerned, to all parts of the globe.
On the first of October, 1907, a further reduction was made when
the unit of weight for outward foreign and colonial letters was
raised from half an ounce to an ounce, and the charge on foreign
letters for each unit after the first was reduced from 2&#189;<i>d.</i>
to 1&#189;<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after acquiring the money order business from the managing
proprietors, the Post Office reduced the rates of commission
to 3<i>d.</i> for orders not exceeding £2 in value, and 6<i>d.</i> for orders above
£2 but not over £5, the latter sum being at that time the maximum.
In 1862 the issue of orders for larger sums was allowed at the
following rates: 9<i>d.</i> when not in excess of £7, and 12<i>d.</i> between
<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>£7 and £10. On the first day of May, 1871, a further reduction
was made and the following scale of charges announced: for
sums under 10<i>s.</i>, a penny; between 10<i>s.</i> and £1, 2<i>d.</i>; between £1
and £2, 3<i>d.</i>, and an additional penny for each additional pound to
the £10 limit. It was found, however, that the low rate of a penny
for small orders did not pay, and a decision was reached to raise the
rate for these small orders and provide a cheaper means for their
remittance by post. In pursuance of this policy the rate for orders
under 10<i>s.</i> was increased to 2<i>d.</i>, for orders between 10<i>s.</i> and £1 to
3<i>d.</i>, and in 1881 the following rates were announced for postal
notes: a halfpenny for notes of the value of 1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a penny
for notes of the value of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 5<i>s.</i> and 7<i>s.</i>, 6<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i> for notes costing
10<i>s.</i>, 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 15<i>s.</i>, 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and 20<i>s.</i> In 1884 a new series of postal
orders was issued, the 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> notes being dropped
and new notes issued of the value of 2<i>s.</i>, 3<i>s.</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 4<i>s.</i>, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 10<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> for a penny each and the rate on the 15<i>s.</i> and 20<i>s.</i> notes was
reduced to 1&#189;<i>d.</i> In 1903 still others were introduced with the result
that a postal order may now be obtained for every complete 6<i>d.</i>
from 6<i>d.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> and for 21<i>s.</i> and broken sums to the value of 5<i>d.</i>
may be made up by affixing postage stamps. Finally, in 1905, the
poundage on postal notes for 2<i>s.</i> and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was reduced from 1<i>d.</i>
to a halfpenny, and on postal orders for 11<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> inclusive from
1&#189;<i>d.</i> to 1<i>d.</i> In 1886 the money order rates were reduced as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In addition to the reductions in rates which have been outlined
above, other changes have been made which have resulted in certain
cases in a saving to the transmitter of a money order. The
charge for correcting or altering the name of the remitter or payee
of an inland order has been reduced to the fixed sum of a penny.
The fee payable for stopping payment of an inland order was fixed
at 4<i>d.</i>, and this was made to cover the issue of a new order if the
request was made at the time of stopping payment. A penny stamp
need no longer be affixed to a money order when payment is deferred
and payment may be deferred for any period not exceeding
ten days.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>The issue of telegraph money orders, commenced in 1889 as an
experiment, was in 1892 extended to all money order offices which
were also telegraph offices. The limit imposed was £10, the rates

<p>There was an additional charge of at least 9<i>d.</i> for the official
telegram, authorizing payment, which was sent in duplicate. When
several orders were sent at the same time and the total amount
<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>did not exceed £50, only one official telegram was sent and paid
for. The above rates were lowered in 1897 to 4<i>d.</i> for sums not in
excess of £3, and 6<i>d.</i> for sums from £3 to £10 with a minimum
charge of 6<i>d.</i> for the official telegram of advice.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> At the present
time inland telegraph money orders may be issued for the same
amounts as ordinary inland money orders and at the same rates,
plus a fee of 2<i>d.</i> and the cost of the official telegram.</p>

<p>During the Crimean War, the Army Post Office was authorized
to issue money orders at inland rates and the system was extended
to Gibraltar and Malta. In 1858 a proposition advanced by Canada
for the interchange of money orders was favourably received
by the Home Government, and in the following year provision was
made for their issue between the United Kingdom and Canada at
four times the inland rates, to a limit of £5. In 1862 the system
was extended to all the colonies, the rates being the same as those
already agreed upon with Canada except in the case of Gibraltar
and Malta where they were three times the inland rates, and the
maximum was increased to £10. In 1868 a money order convention
was concluded with Switzerland, the rates being the same as those
for inland orders, and in 1869 a similar agreement was made with
Belgium, but in 1871 the rates for both countries were increased to
three times the inland rates upon the same terms as those prevailing
with other parts of Europe. In 1880 colonial rates were reduced
to the same level, and in 1883 the following changes were adopted:</p>

<p>By 1903 most foreign countries and some of the colonies had
agreed to a further reduction of rates and to a £40 limit. In 1905
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180">[180]</a></span>the poundage on foreign money orders not exceeding £1 in value
was diminished from 4<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>There is no record of the yearly expenses of the Government for
the maintenance of the posts until the accession of James I.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> There
are many instances of the issue of warrants for the payment of the
posts but it is not known how long a period they were intended to
cover.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> There was no systematic financial method in dealing with
this phase of the postal question. The postmen remained unpaid
for years at a time. After sufficient clamour, part of the arrears
would be met, but it is impossible to say how much of the sum paid
was for current expenses and how much for old debts.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> It might
be supposed from the fact that they received fixed daily wages that
some idea might be obtained of the cost of management. But their
wages often remained unpaid and the number of postmen varied,
as new routes were manned or old routes discontinued, so that any
figures for the period before the seventeenth century would be mere
guesses.</p>

<p>Until 1626<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> our knowledge of the finances of the Post Office is
concerned with expenses only, for there was no product, gross or
net, for the state. In 1603, the cost of the posts was £4150 a year.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
This was the year of James the First's accession, and to this is
probably due the fact that payment was made for an entire year.
Then there comes a break of several years' duration. In 1621, arrears
for the half year ending March 31, 1619, were paid. They
amounted to £917. For the next two years the yearly expenses
averaged £2984. The total expenses for the financial year ending
in March, 1621, were £3404. All the posts to Berwick received 92<i>s.</i>
a day, to Dover 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, to Holyhead 36<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and £130 a year for a
sailing packet, to Plymouth 25<i>s.</i> a day. The wages for each postmaster
<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>varied from 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a day. In addition there was
an expenditure of £50 for extraordinary posts and 5<i>s.</i> a day to the
paymaster.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> In 1625, the ordinary expenses were about £4300 a
year.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> It is disappointing not to be able to make any more definite
statements concerning the financial operations of the Post Office
before 1635, but the unbusinesslike system under which it was conducted
must take the blame.</p>

<p>Our ideas of the financial operations of the Post Office from 1635
to 1711 are somewhat clearer than during the preceding period.
We know that Witherings' aim was to make the system self-supporting.
It had probably not entered into his head that it might ever
be anything more. After the sequestration of the position of
Postmaster-General to Burlamachi, he was called upon to render an
account of the financial proceedings of the Post Office during the
short period that he was in charge.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> He reported that from August
4, 1640, to December 25, 1641, the receipts had been £8363 and the
expenditure £4867. £1400 of the balance had been paid to the
Secretary of State and "of the remaining £2000, those that keep
the office are to be considered for their pains and attendance."
This is rather vague but the report shows that the Post Office was
self-supporting only six years after Witherings' reforms had been
adopted.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Prideaux reported at an early period in his régime that,
with the exception of the Dover road and the Holyhead packet, the
posts paid for themselves.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> After the Post Office was farmed, there
can be no doubt as to the total net revenue, but it is impossible to
say how much the farmer made over and above the amount of
his farm or how large his expenses were. Manley paid the state
£10,000 a year and is said to have made £14,000 during the six
years that he farmed the Posts.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> In 1659 the rent was raised to
£14,000<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> a year, and in 1660 there was a further advance to
£21,500.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Of this £21,500 the Duke of York received £16,117 and
the rest was spent largely in paying pensions and for a few minor
<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>expenses such as the payment of the Court Postmaster.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> By the
act of 1663, the net Post Office revenue was settled upon the Duke
of York and his male heirs, with the exception of about £5000 a
year, that being the amount of the pension charges on the revenue.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>
Certain deductions were made from the sum total of rent due, on
account of the loss to the farmer from the activity of the interlopers,
and the deficit was ordered to be made up from some other
branch of the royal revenue.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>After James II took his involuntary departure from England, his
pecuniary interest in the Post Office ceased. In 1690, an act of
Parliament was passed, making the receipts from the Post Office
payable into the Exchequer. They were to be used among other
things to pay the interest on £250,000 borrowed to carry on the
war.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> From 1690 to 1710, the gross receipts rose from about
£70,000 to £90,000 a year, no consideration being taken of the ups
and downs caused by the French wars.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Complaint was made by
the Lords that a large part of the postal revenue was wasted in paying
pensions.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> The Duchess of Cleveland received £4700 a year
and William's Dutch General, the Duke of Schomberg, £4000 a
year. Poor William Dockwra, the only one of the lot who had ever
done anything for the Post Office, was at the end of the list with
only £500 a year, terminable in 1697.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> The sum total of money
payable in pensions from the post revenue in 1695 was £21,200.
The packet boats at the same time cost £13,000, and but £10,000
was spent for salaries and wages. The net revenue in 1694 was
£59,972, the gross being about £88,000.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>During the eighteenth century the postal revenue still continued
to be burdened with the pensions of favourites, deserving and undeserving.
Queen Anne asked Parliament to settle £5000 a year
upon the Duke of Marlborough and his heirs. The House of Commons
replied that they very much regretted that they could not do
<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>so for the Post Office was already paying too much in pensions.
Probably the real reason for their refusal was the fact that the
Duke and the war party were becoming unpopular. However, the
Queen granted him the pension for her own life as she had a legal
right to do. In 1713, the total amount of pensions payable from the
postal revenue was £22,120. Before the act of 1711 was passed,
the Scotch Office had paid £210 to each of the Universities of Edinburgh
and Glasgow. This continued to be granted after the two
Offices were united.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>Our knowledge of the financial operations of the Post Office
during the eighteenth century is much more extensive than during
the seventeenth, owing to the reports made by the Post Office
officials to the Parliamentary committees, appointed to enquire
into abuses. The reports are all signed by the Accountant-General
or his deputy, and are therefore as trustworthy as anything which
can be obtained. They show that during the first half of the century,
or more explicitly from 1717 to 1754, there was a very small
annual increase in gross product, with an actual decrease in net product,
and of course an increase in expenditure. In round numbers
the average yearly gross product for the years 1725-29 was
£179,000, the net product for the same period being £98,000 and
the expenses of management £81,000. For the five years from 1750
to 1754, the average annual gross product was £207,000, net product
£97,000, and expenses £110,000. It is not surprising that there
was no increase worthy of the name in the gross product, for the
period under consideration was a time of stagnation, an intermediate
stage just before the dawn of the industrial revolution. The
actual decrease in net product or, what amounts to the same thing,
the increase in expenses of management, is due largely to the abuse
of the franking privilege, the large amounts received in fees and
emoluments, the extraordinary way in which the packet service
was mismanaged, and the losses and increased expense due to war.
Enough has been said about all but the last of these causes. The
Post Office suffered most during war from increased expenses and
direct losses in connection with the sailing packets. The placing
of these upon a war footing involved considerable increased cost.
<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>In the second place, extra boats were used for political purposes
in addition to those regularly employed, and it was customary for
the Post Office to make good to the owners all damages inflicted
by the enemy. From 1725 to 1739, the expenses of the Post
Office averaged £80,000 or £90,000 a year. Then came the War of
the Austrian Succession, when the expenses averaged £105,000
per year from 1745 to 1749. The five following years being a
period of peace, the average annual expenses were £110,000, while
the Seven Years' War brought them up to £147,000. It may be
thought that expenses should become normal again when war has
ceased, but it has generally proved to be the rule that although
peace brings a decrease, yet the expenditure does not fall quite so
low as before the war.</p>

<p>From 1755 to the end of the century there is a marked rise both
in gross and net receipts and a comparative diminution in expenses.
The gross average annual product from 1755 to 1759 was £228,000,
from 1790 to 1794 it was £602,000. For the five years from 1755 to
1759 the average yearly net product was £81,000, from 1790 to
1794 it was £375,000, while expenses had risen for the same periods
only from £147,000 to £227,000. The following table shows the
average yearly increase or decrease in gross product, expenses, and
net products for the six five-year periods from 1765 to 1794. The
increases or decreases are given in the form of percentages, each
five-year period being compared with the preceding period.

<p>The net product from both the Scotch and Irish Posts was remitted
to England. These receipts did not amount to much as
compared with those from the English Post. Earl Temple, Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, in writing to Grenville in 1784, said that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185">[185]</a></span>Irish post "had never paid £8000 a year clear of expenses."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> In
1796, the gross product was £26,949 and the expenses of management
£8718. Of the net product, £6651 were retained, being
placed to the credit of Great Britain for returned and missent
letters and for the £4000 which the Irish Post was entitled to
receive in lieu of the receipts from the Holyhead packet boats.
The remaining £11,579 were sent to the general Post Office. The
Scotch Posts did considerably better. The gross product in 1796
was £69,338, the expenses of management £14,346, for returned letters
£1206, and the net product sent to the General Office was
£54,265.</p>

<p>The time had long since passed when the London-Dover road
was the most important in the kingdom and when the receipts from
foreign exceeded those from inland letters. As late as 1653, when
contracts were called for from those wishing to farm the posts, the
amount offered in one instance was almost as great for the foreign
as for the inland post. The average annual gross product from the
foreign post for the period 1785-89 was £61,431, the expenses
£32,169 and the net product £29,262. For the period from 1790 to
1794 there was a small increase to £65,497 for gross product,
£34,277 for expenses, and £31,200 for net product.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>The receipts from the London Penny Post were never an important
factor in postal finance but it had always paid for itself and
given a reasonable surplus. Its importance was due more to its
social value in affording a cheaper letter rate and a speedier postal
service than the General Post. The average yearly gross product
from 1785-94 was £10,508, expenses £5177, and net product
£5331. After Johnson had improved it so much, it produced a
yearly average gross product from 1795 to 1797 of £26,283. Expenses
averaged £18,960 and net product £7323.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the receipts from bye and cross post
letters amounted to very little. So little was expected from them
that no provision was made for checking the postage on them. It
was taken for granted that all letters would pass to, from, or
through London. In 1720 they brought in only £3700. Allen had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186">[186]</a></span>done much to increase the revenue, but it was not until the last
part of the eighteenth century that the increase was at all marked.
From 1780 to 1784, the average annual gross product was £77,911,
expenses £12,346 and net product £65,565. From 1785 to 1789,
these had increased respectively to £104,817, £11,589, and £93,228,
and from 1790 to 1794 to £140,974, £15,030, and £125,944. The
small expense for these letters is explained by the fact that the
separate department for bye and cross post letters was debited
with only a portion of the total cost, the larger part being carried
by the general establishment.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>The financial history of the Post Office from the beginning of the
nineteenth century to 1838 is a rather depressing record.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> From
1805 until 1820 both the gross and net receipts had increased steadily
although not rapidly, but for the remainder of the period the
revenue was practically stationary. During the five-year periods,
1820-24 and 1830-34, there had been a decrease in gross receipts,
and during the latter of these periods the net receipts had been kept
a little ahead of the five-year period 1815-19 only by a decrease in
expenditure.</p>

<p>The annual gross receipts from Scotland had increased from
£117,108 during the period 1800-04 to £204,481 during the period
1830-34, the annual net receipts for the same periods being
£98,156 and £149,752. The relatively large increase in expenses
from £18,952 to £54,729 had been due largely to the payment of
mail coach tolls after 1814, amounting to something under
£20,000 a year.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Ireland started with a smaller gross revenue,
£92,745 a year during the period 1800-04, but a larger annual
expenditure £64,368,<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> and comparatively small net receipts of
£28,377. Gross receipts, expenses, and net receipts had increased
slowly throughout the first thirty-four years of the nineteenth century
with the exception of the period 1820-24. For the five years
from 1830 to 1834 inclusive they amounted to £244,098, £108,898,
and £135,200 respectively.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>The increases in rates in 1801, 1805, and 1812 had not produced
the desired and expected results. The increase in 1801 had been
estimated to produce £150,000 but results showed that this estimate
was too large by £35,000. In 1805, the additional penny had
resulted in an increase of only £136,000, inclusive of any natural
increase of revenue, although it had been estimated to produce
£230,000. The third increase in rates in 1812 proved even less
productive. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he expected
it to produce £200,000. As a matter of fact the revenue increased
only £77,892 in amount. The fact of the matter was that rates
were already so high that an increase only led to greater efforts to
evade the payment of postage. As a system of taxation the Post
Office had become rigid. It could yield no more with postage as
high as it had been forced by the acts of 1801 and 1805. But, considered
primarily as a taxing medium, and it had been considered
as such for 200 years, it could hardly be called a failure. We flatter
ourselves that our idea of the Post Office is broader in its scope and
more utilitarian in its object but we have the good fortune to live
several generations after 1840. What England demanded was
revenue and still more revenue, and a postal system which could
produce £70 net for every £100 collected had some excuse for its
existence.</p>

<p>Rowland Hill has pointed out that from 1815 to 1835 the population
had increased from 19,552,000 to 25,605,000 while the net
revenue from the Post Office had remained practically stationary.
He said nothing, however, about the industrial depression of the
country during that period nor of the political and economic crisis
through which England was passing. He referred to the great increase
in the postal revenue of the United States during the same
period; on the one hand, a nation with immense natural resources
and a population doubling itself every generation, and on the other
hand, a people inhabiting two small islands, making heroic efforts
to recover from a most burdensome war.</p>

<p>With the introduction of penny postage the gross revenue of the
Post Office fell from £2,390,763 in 1840 to £1,359,466 in 1841, and
did not fully recover from the decreased postage rates for twelve
years. The cost of management, on the other hand, increased only<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
from £756,999 in 1840 to £858,677 in 1841. But the financial loss
is shown most plainly in the falling off in net revenue from £1,633,764
to £500,789. If we exclude packet expenses, and such was the practice
until 1858, the net revenue did not again reach the maximum
figure of high postage days until 1862. Including packet expenses
we find that the net revenue did not fully recover until the early
seventies. The average yearly gross revenue for the period from
1841-45 was £1,658,214, expenditure £1,001,405, and the net
revenue £656,809. These all increased steadily and on the whole
proportionately until 1860, the average yearly figures for the preceding
five years being £3,135,587, £1,785,911, and £1,349,676. In
1858 the packet expenses are included under cost of management
and their enormous increase from the beginning of the century
sadly depleted the net revenue. It seems more advisable, however,
not to include them until 1860 when the packets passed from the
control of the Admiralty to that of the Post Office. The average
gross revenue for the years 1861 to 1865 was £4,016,750, expenditure
(including packets) £3,013,389, and net revenue £1,003,341.
During the next quarter of a century these increased to £6,326,141,
£4,019,423, and £2,306,718 respectively, exclusive of telegraph
receipts and expenditures. For the five years ending 31st March,
1906, the average gross revenue was £15,926,905, expenditure
£11,156,292, and net revenue £4,770,613.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center"><b>THE QUESTION OF MONOPOLY</b></p>


<p>The question of the state's monopoly and the opposing efforts of
the interlopers to break this monopoly resolves itself into a consideration
of the way in which private letters were carried, for the public
letters were entirely at the disposal of the state to be dealt with
as it saw fit. From the sixteenth century there were several ways
in which private letters might be conveyed. Within the kingdom
they might be sent by the common carriers, friends, special messengers,
or the Royal Posts. Letters sent abroad were carried by
the Royal Posts, the Merchant Adventurers' Posts, the Strangers'
Posts, and the Merchants' Posts while they lasted. The fact that
private letters were conveyed by the Royal Posts is generally expressed
in rather indefinite terms or by references to proclamations,
but that they were actually so conveyed is entirely beyond doubt.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
In 1585 a certain Mr. Lewkenor informed Walsingham that the
post just landed had brought many letters directed to merchants,
besides those for the Court and Government. He asked whether
he might open those letters which were directed to suspected merchants.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>
This reference is of course to letters coming from abroad.
The same holds true of inland letters, for in 1583 Randolph, the
Postmaster-General, wrote to Walsingham, enclosing the names of
those "who charge the posts with their private letters and commissions
at a penny the mile."<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>In 1591 the first proclamation affirming the government monopoly
in the foreign posts was issued. All persons except the Postmaster-General
and his deputies were forbidden "directly or indirectly
to gather up, receive, bring in or carry out of this realm any
letters or packets," the only exceptions being in the case of the
<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>despatches of the principal Secretaries of State, of Ambassadors,
and others sufficiently authorized. An appendix to the same proclamation
commanded all mayors, bailiffs, sheriffs, justices, etc.,
and especially all searchers to be on the watch for men coming into
or going out of the realm with packets or letters. In this last part
of the proclamation we can see why it was thought necessary to
restrict the carriage of letters to and from foreign countries to the
Royal Posts. It was done that the Government might be able to
discover any treasonable or seditious correspondence. This did not
always remain the object of the state in restricting competition but
was succeeded later by other and different motives. In order that
there might be no doubt about the whole question, the Postmaster-General
received word from the Council to inform the London merchants,
foreigners as well as British subjects and all others whom it
might concern, that they should no longer employ any others to
carry their letters than those legally appointed in accordance with
the terms of the proclamation.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>In 1602 the first order concerning the despatch of private letters
within the kingdom was issued to the Royal Posts. "The Posts for
the Queen's immediate service"<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> were allowed to carry only state
despatches, directed by members of the council, the Postmaster-General
and certain officials. Such despatches when sent by the
regular posts were to be forwarded immediately. The letters of all
other persons allowed to write by post must wait for the regular
departure of the postmen. In the orders to the posts issued in 1609,
the first article reads as follows: "No pacquets or letters shall be
sent by the Posts or bind any Post to ride therewith but those on
Our special affairs."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The first part of this is certainly strong but it
is modified by the succeeding clause "nor bind any Post to ride
therewith." Evidently he might if he wished, and he would probably
hesitate longer over a state packet for the conveyance of which
he was never assured of anything than over a private letter for
which he was certain of his pay.</p>

<p>It was the custom after 1609 to follow the appointment of every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191">[191]</a></span>new Postmaster-General with a proclamation assigning him and his
deputies the sole privilege of carrying all letters and reading anathema
upon all interlopers.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> Thus King James favoured Stanhope,
his Postmaster-General, with a grant of monopoly.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> On de Quester's
appointment as Foreign Postmaster-General a proclamation was
issued, forbidding any but his agents from having anything to
do with foreign letters.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> In spite of the improvements which he
inaugurated, we find him asking the King a few years later to
renew his patent of monopoly and his request was granted.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> He
was evidently suffering from competition. But the Merchant
Adventurers' Posts were not yet dead and their Postmaster,
Billingsley, abetted by the House of Commons,<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> gave de Quester
so much trouble that he was imprisoned by the Council's
order.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime the postmen on the London-Plymouth road had
petitioned the Council that they alone should carry the letters and
despatches of the merchants over their road. They said they had
so improved the service between London and Plymouth that letters
were now despatched between the two cities in three days
and an answer might be received within one week from the time
of first writing. Their complaint was against a certain Samuel
Jude, who had undertaken the conveyance of the London merchants'
letters. Jude himself acknowledged this, but said that he
had never meddled with the "through" post by which he meant
the travellers' post.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>So long as the Royal Posts did not give satisfaction, competition
was inevitable. Under Witherings they had improved so much that
what competition there was, received no support from the London
merchants. In 1633 they addressed a petition to the King, praying
that he would protect Witherings from some strangers in London,
<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>who had set up posts of their own. They pointed out how he, acting
with some foreign postmasters, had set up packet posts, travelling
day and night. By means of these, letters were conveyed between
London and Antwerp in three days, while the messengers needed
from eight to fourteen days to travel the same distance.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> The common
carriers were giving trouble in the despatch of inland letters at
the same time that competition in the foreign posts was attracting
attention.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> It was their custom to send their carts on ahead while
they lingered to collect letters. After the collection they hastened
on, leaving their carts behind, and delivered the letters on the way.
It was provided that no carrier should stay longer than eight hours
in a place after his cart had left it, or arrive in any place eight hours
ahead of it.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> As long as their speed was governed by that of their
lumbering carts over the wretched roads, no fear was felt that their
competition would prove troublesome.</p>

<p>With the growing strength of Parliament, more and more opposition
was made to the grants of monopoly and their enforcement.
In 1642 the House of Commons passed a resolution "affirming that
the taking of the letters from the several carriers and the several
restraints and imprisonments of Grover, Chapman, Cotton, and
Mackerill are against the law." The House proceeded to state that
these several persons should have reparation and damages from
Coke, Windebank, and Witherings.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Four years later a report was
made by Justices Pheasant and Rolls on Witherings' patent.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> They
held that the clause of restraint in the grant to Witherings was
void.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> This decision was quite in accordance with the views of
Parliament when they opposed the King and all his works. But
after Parliament had obtained control of the Posts, "the President
and Governors of the Poor of the City of London" proposed to the
Common Council that the City should establish a postal system in
order to raise money for the relief of the poor in London. A committee
was appointed to inform Warwick, Prideaux, and Witherings
<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>of their intention. At the same time an attempt to lay a petition
before Parliament on the question failed. Counsel's advice was
sought and obtained in favour of the undertaking and in 1650 the
Committee received orders to settle the stages. At the end of six
weeks they had established postal communications with Scotland
and other places. Complaint was made to Parliament, and the
Commons passed a resolution "that the office of Postmaster, inland
and foreign, is and ought to be in the sole power and disposal of the
Parliament." The same year the city posts were suppressed.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>Oxenbridge and his friends who had set up posts of their own
gave Prideaux and Manley the hardest fight that any Postmaster-General
ever had to encounter from interlopers. Joyce says that
Oxenbridge had acted as Prideaux' deputy.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> If this is so, he was
soon up in arms against his superior. In accordance with the judicial
decision that the clause in Witherings' patent giving him a
monopoly of the carriage of letters was void, Oxenbridge, Blackwall,
Thomson, and Malyn had undertaken the private conveyance
of letters and had set up posts of their own. Prideaux had charged
6<i>d.</i> for each letter and had organized weekly posts from and to
London. Oxenbridge charged only 3<i>d.</i> and his posts went from and
to London three times a week. Prideaux then did the same and set
up posters announcing that the interlopers' posts would be stopped.
His agents assaulted Oxenbridge's servants and killed one of them.
He also stopped his rival's mails on Sundays but allowed his own
to proceed as on other days. In addition to his regular tri-weekly
mails, Oxenbridge provided packet boats for Ireland and intended
to settle stages between London and Yarmouth and the other
places named by the Council of State.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> To proceed in Oxenbridge's
own words: "Suddenly contracts were called for. We offered £9100
a year through Ben Andrews, £800 more than was offered by Manley,
yet Colonel Rich allowed Manley to take advantage of an offer
made by Kendall then absent and not privy to it for £10,000 a
year. Consideration had been offered by Council, but Manley had
broken into our offices, taken letters, and had forbidden us from
<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>having anything to do with the post." An order of the Council of
State, bearing the same date as the grant to Manley, was sent to
Oxenbridge and his friends, informing them that Manley had been
given the sole right to the inland and foreign letter offices.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> This
did not end the controversy, for six months later we find Oxenbridge
and Thomson complaining that a monopoly in carrying letters had
been given to Manley. They claimed that all who wished should be
allowed to carry letters at the ordinary rates.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>Of all the interlopers up to the middle of the seventeenth century,
Oxenbridge had proved himself by far the ablest. From the
point of view of the legal decision of 1646 and the position of
Parliament before 1640, his position was unassailable. With the
present policy of the Post Office in view, his actions will probably
be condemned by the majority. But in 1650 conditions were entirely
different. Before 1635 the state had either tacitly allowed the
carriage of private letters to the profit of the postmen or had officially
taken over such carriage; but in this case it was largely for the
purpose of keeping in touch with the plots of the times. For 200
years after 1635 the idea was to make money from the conveyance
of private letters. The effects of Oxenbridge's efforts were certainly
beneficial if we are to believe his own story. Prideaux had been
forced to cut his rates in half in order to meet competition. The
credit for this must lie with the interloper rather than with the
monopolist.</p>

<p>At the same time that Oxenbridge was giving so much trouble,
letters were being carried by private hands in Bury, Dover, and
Norwich. The offenders were summoned before the council for
contempt and severely reprimanded.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Petitions came from Thetford
and Norwich complaining that their messenger had been summoned
to present himself before the Council within twenty-four
hours and had to travel 100 miles within that time, an impossibility
in the opinion of the petitioners.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> As late as 1635, Prideaux, the
Attorney-General, gave his opinion that Parliament's monopolistic
resolution of that year affected only the office of Postmaster-General
and not the carrying of letters.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> Perhaps this was only a
bit of spite on his part after Manley had succeeded to his old position.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195">[195]</a></span></p>
<p>The usual monopolistic powers, hitherto granted by proclamation,
were embodied in the first act of Parliament, establishing the
postal system for England, Ireland, and Scotland in 1657. The
Postmaster-General was given the sole power to take up, carry and
convey all letters and packets from and to all parts of the Commonwealth
and to any place beyond the seas where he might establish
posts. He alone was to employ foot posts, horse posts, and packet
boats. Some exceptions were made to these general rules. Letters
were allowed to be conveyed by carriers so long as they were carried
in their carts or on their pack-horses. The other exceptions
were in the case of letters of advice sent by merchants in their ships
and proceeding no farther than the ships themselves, and also in
the case of a letter sent by a special messenger on the affairs of the
sender, and in the case of a letter sent by a friend. Penalties were
attached for disobedience to this part of the act, one half of the fine
to go to the informer.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> The same provisions were enacted almost
word for word in the act of 1660, with the addition that letters
might be carried by any one between any place and the nearest post
road for delivery to the postman.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>After the restoration and for some months before the act of 1660
was passed, Bishop had acted as farmer of the posts. In the absence
of any law on the subject, the King's proclamation granting a
monopoly<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> to Bishop was freely disregarded.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Competing posts to
and from London sprang up, lessening the receipts which he would
otherwise have obtained from the carriage of letters. It was calculated
that during the three months before these interlopers could
be suppressed Bishop lost £500 through them, and orders were
given to allow him an abatement in his rent to that amount.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>In 1663 a certain Thomas Ibson attempted to come to an agreement
with the postmasters on the Holyhead road. He wished to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196">[196]</a></span>have the privilege of horsing travellers and made an offer to the
postmasters to take charge of the post houses if they would allow
him to proceed. He told them that they should make an attempt
to have their salaries restored to their old value by Bishop, who had
raised so much from them by fines and lowering their salaries. The
Postmaster-General told his deputies that if they dared to treat
with the "would-be" interloper he would dismiss them, and the
whole thing fell through.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> At the same time a warrant was issued
by the Council to mayors and other officials to search for and apprehend
all persons carrying letters for hire, without licence from the
Postmaster-General.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Nevertheless interloping did not cease, as is
shown by the complaints from the postmasters.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>In the proclamation following the appointment of O'Neale as
Postmaster-General in 1663, it was ordered that no one should dare
to detain or open a letter not addressed to himself unless under
a warrant from one of the Secretaries of State. An exception was
made in the case of letters carried by unauthorized persons. Such
letters should be seized and sent to the Privy Council. In later
proclamations it was provided that they might be sent also to one
of the Secretaries of State in order that the persons sending or
conveying them might be punished.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>After Lord Arlington's appointment as Postmaster-General, he
addressed a petition to the Duke of York complaining "that carriers,
proprietors of stage coaches and others take upon themselves
to collect letters to an incredible number and on some stages double
what the post brings." On account of this he pointed out to His
Royal Highness that a considerable part of his revenue was lost.
This was quite true since the Post Office had ceased to be farmed
and the whole net revenue went to the Duke.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> This was followed
the same year by a proclamation forbidding any one to collect or
carry letters without the authority of the Postmasters-General.
Carriers were forbidden to convey any letters which were not on
matters relating to goods in their carts. Shipmasters must carry no
letters beyond the first stage after their arrival in England with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197">[197]</a></span>exception of the letters of merchants and owners. Searchers were
appointed to see that the proclamation was enforced.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> It was even
proposed to suppress all hackney coaches, the principal reason
given being that they decreased the value of the Duke's monopoly
by carrying multitudes of letters.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p>It is a curious and interesting fact that for a short time London
had a Half Penny Post, established in 1708 by a Mr. Povey in opposition
to the regular Penny Post. The idea was much the same as
that of Dockwra's although Povey seems to have been a far more
belligerent individual than his forerunner in the work. The Postmasters-General
tried to come to some compromise with him but
he would not listen to them. Finally legal action was brought
against him, based on the monopoly granted by the act of 1660.
Povey lost the suit and his project fell through.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> His was the last
attempt to organize a regular system of competing posts. During
the remainder of the eighteenth century, improvements in postal
communications disarmed much of the former opposition. Considerable
damage was received from the superior speed with which
letters might be sent by coaches but, after they were adopted by
the Post Office, matters naturally adjusted themselves. Private
vessels continued to convey letters which had not paid the rates
prescribed in such cases by the act of 1711, but this breach of the
law was tolerated by the Post Office.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

<p>Before the nineteenth century, opposition to the government
monopoly had taken the form of competing systems of communication,
started primarily for the sake of making money and at the
same time vindicating the principle of competition. During the
first forty years of the nineteenth century there was no opposition
to the Post Office as a monopoly. The widespread dissatisfaction
was due to the exorbitant rates of postage and this dissatisfaction
expressed itself in attempts to evade these rates but, with the exception
of individual messengers and carriers, there was no competing
system of postal communication established. Opposition
took the form of evasion of postage payments by legal and illegal
means. The various exceptions to the government monopoly continued
<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>unchanged<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> until still further modified in 1837. The additional
modifications were in the case of commissions and returns,
affidavits, writs and legal proceedings, and letters sent out of the
United Kingdom by private vessels.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> The penalty for infringing
upon the postal monopoly was placed at £5 for every offence or
£100 a week if the offence was continued.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>During the official postal year from July 1831 to July 1832, there
were 133 successful prosecutions for illegally sending and conveying
letters. The fines collected amounted to £1635, the costs paid by
defendants to £1085. The prosecutions were generally for a few
letters only and the great majority of the cases were brought in
Manchester. In the case of forty-one additional actions, the Postmaster-General
did not enforce the penalties, certain explanations
having been given.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> Rowland Hill thought that the conveyance of
letters by private and unauthorized people was very widespread
and the Solicitor of the Post Office agreed with him.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<p>The reports of the Committee appointed to enquire into the condition
of the Post Office and to hear the opinions of officials and the
public concerning the introduction of Penny Postage disclosed an
amazing state of affairs. The opinion that evasion of postage was
more or less general had been held by the public for some time as
well as by a few of the Post Office officials<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> but, after the evidence
upon the question was published, there was no longer any doubt
that the views of the public were correct. Some difficulty had been
anticipated that men who had violated the law of the land would
prefer not to confess their misdeeds before a Parliamentary Committee.
They were accordingly assured that any evidence given
would not be used against them, and the names of some were expressed
by letters only, when the reports were published.</p>

<p>The means by which postage rates were evaded may be conveniently
grouped under two main heads, legal and illegal. The most
<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>common methods of evading postage in whole or in part by legal
means were:&mdash;</p>

<p>
By the use of Parliamentary and Official franks.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a><br />
By enclosing invoices and other communications in goods.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a><br />
By the use of codes and signals expressed by sending<br />
particular newspapers or, when something in the nature<br />
of news or reports was to be communicated to many, an<br />
advertisement or report was printed in a newspaper and<br />
the newspapers were sent.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a><br />
By means of a letter or package sent to a mercantile house<br />
with many letters on one sheet of paper for other people.<br />
These were delivered by messengers. Money was sometimes<br />
sent in the same way.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Many factors in Ireland had circulars printed, which went free,
as newspapers. Their correspondents were distinguished by numbers
and opposite the numbers were printed the communications
for each particular person.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>The majority of letters which paid no postage or only partial
postage were sent illegally, most of them by carriers. "A. B." said
that in 1836 his mercantile house sent 2068 letters by post and 5861
by other means, principally by carriers, for one penny each.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> "C.
D." testified that carriers called once or twice a day at his house
and that they received from 100 to 150 letters a week from him.
Sometimes the carriers delivered the letters on foot, sometimes they
went by coach.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> "E. F.'s" letters were carried by newsmen, who
distributed the local newspaper.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> "G. H.," a carrier from Scotland,
said that there were six others working with him and that they delivered about 700 letters and parcels a day, for which they received
1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> each.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Letters were also illegally conveyed:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>
<p>By "free-packets," containing the patterns and correspondence
of merchants, which the coachmen carried free except for the booking
fee of 4<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></p>

<p>In warehousemen's bales and parcels.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>In weavers' bags, especially near Glasgow. These were bags containing
work for the weavers, sent by and returned to the manufacturers.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>By "family-boxes." Students at college in Glasgow and Edinburgh
were accustomed to receive boxes of provisions, etc., from
home. The neighbours made use of them to carry letters.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>By coachmen, guards, travellers and private individuals.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p>By vans, railways, stage-coaches, steamboats, and every conceivable
means.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>By writing in newspapers, sometimes with invisible ink or by
enclosing accounts or letters in them.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>About half of the letters and parcels sent to the seaports for
transmission to foreign parts by private ships did not go through
the Post Office,<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> and this practice was more or less winked at by
the authorities.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> The letters from Liverpool for the United States
numbered 122,000 a year, but only 69,000 of these passed through
the Post Office.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>Since the Post Office has adopted the policy of charging low
uniform rates of postage there has been no concerted attempt to
infringe upon its monopoly. The dissatisfied do not now attempt
to establish competing posts nor to evade the payment of the legal
rates. Any pressure which may be brought to remedy real or supposed
grievances takes the form of an attempt to influence the
department itself. It is true that a private messenger service was
established for the delivery of letters, but the promoters of that
service seem to have been unaware of the fact that they were acting
in violation of the law, and a satisfactory agreement with the
department was soon concluded. As a matter of fact, it is a question
<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>whether succeeding governments have not been too subservient
in granting the demands of certain sections of the people, notably
in connection with the telegraph and telephone systems and the
question of guarantees. The position of a government which has
abandoned the principle that any extension of services or change
in postal policy shall be based upon present or anticipated financial
success must necessarily be a difficult one.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center"><b>THE TELEGRAPH SYSTEM AS A BRANCH OF THE POSTAL
DEPARTMENT</b></p>


<p>Previous to the acquisition of the telegraphs by the state, the
different telegraphic companies carried on their business in comparative
harmony, a harmony which was occasionally disturbed by
the entrance into the field of competition of new claimants for the
confidence of the public. By far the most important of these companies
in 1855 were the Electric and International, and the British
and Irish Magnetic, controlling between them about 8500 miles
of line and having 600 stations open to the public. During the succeeding
ten years, by the growth of the old companies and an increase
in the number of the new, the number of miles of line increased
to 16,000, of telegraph stations to 2040. The number of
public messages sent in 1855 was a little more than one million, in
1860 nearly two millions, and in 1865 over four millions and a half.
The rates for a message of twenty words varied from 1<i>s.</i> for a distance
under fifty miles, plus 1<i>s.</i> for each additional fifty miles, to
4<i>s.</i> for a distance over 150 miles and 5<i>s.</i> to Dublin, including free
delivery within half a mile from the telegraph office.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p>In 1860 a competing company, the London District Telegraph
Company, started operations in the Metropolitan District, and
offered a low rate of 6<i>d.</i> a message. In the following year a far
more dangerous rival, the United Kingdom Telegraph Company,
announced that henceforth it would charge a uniform shilling rate
irrespective of distance. Four years later both of these companies
fell into line, forced according to some by the unfair tactics of their
competitors, according to others by the utter impossibility of
making both ends meet, while charging a uniform rate irrespective
of distance. The tariff agreed to in 1865 was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203">[203]</a></span></p>

</table>

<p>In some cases these rates applied only to wires of a single company,
and, where a message was transmitted over the wires of
two or more companies, an additional charge was made. Special
rates were offered for press messages, the news being supplied by
the agency of the intelligence department of the telegraph companies.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>The earliest proposal for government ownership of the telegraphs
seems to have originated with Thomas Allan, the same Allan who
was later instrumental in establishing the United Kingdom Telegraph
Company. In 1854 he submitted arguments to the government
through Sir Rowland Hill in favour of the change, arguments
which met with the approval of Lord Stanley, the President of the
Board of Trade, and Mr. Ricardo, formerly Chairman of the International
Electric Telegraph Company, and ex-member for Stoke.
Two years later Mr. Barnes, an official in the Post Office Department,
submitted to my Lords a plan "for the establishment in connection
with the Post Office of a comprehensive scheme of electric
telegraphs throughout the kingdom." In 1866, Lord Stanley, as
Postmaster-General, in a letter to the Lords of the Treasury
called their attention to the fact that the question of the propriety
of the assumption by the government of the telegraphic systems of
the Kingdom had been revived in the previous year by the Edinburgh
Chamber of Commerce, and still more recently the proposition
had been embodied in a petition from the Association of
Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom. As he himself
had for many years been in favour of such a change and found his
opinion shared by more than one important body of public men,
he directed Mr. Scudamore<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>
to report whether, in his opinion, the telegraphs could
be successfully operated by the Post Office,
whether such operation would result in any advantages to the
<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>public over the present system by means of private companies,
and whether it would entail upon the department any large expenditure
beyond the purchase of existing rights.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p>The report presented by Mr. Scudamore was strongly in favour
of the control of the telegraphs by the Post Office, and is especially
interesting in furnishing an abstract of the evils which the people
considered that the companies were inflicting upon them. The
most important of these evils, real or imaginary, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Exorbitant charges and a resulting failure to expand on the part
of the system.</p>

<p>Delay and inaccuracy in the transmission of messages.</p>

<p>Failure to serve many important towns and communities.</p>

<p>Inconvenient situation, in many places, of the telegraph office,
it being often at a considerable distance from the business centre of
the town, especially when in the railway station.</p>

<p>Inconveniently short periods that offices are open in many
places.</p>

<p>Wasteful competition between the companies.</p>

<p>The strongest argument against the existing condition was rather
a result of competition than private ownership. In the more populous
centres the companies very often had their telegraph offices
at a very short distance from each other, being so situated as to
compete for the public patronage, while other and more outlying
portions of the town were quite unserved. The latter were thus
made to suffer in order that favoured portions might enjoy the
somewhat doubtful boon of competition. In order to show the
failure to extend telegraphic facilities, Mr. Scudamore compiled
a list of towns in England and Wales having an individual population
of two thousand or more. In his own words "So far as telegraphic
accommodation is concerned, while thirty per cent of the
whole number of places named ... are well served, forty per cent
are indifferently served, twelve per cent badly served, and eighteen
per cent, having an aggregate population of more than half a million
persons, not served at all." By combining the telegraphic
business with the postal service, there seemed every reason to suppose
that its advantages could be more widely extended, the hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205">[205]</a></span>of attendance increased, charges reduced, and facilities given for
the transmission of money orders by telegraph.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore proposed to open telegraph offices in all places
which had a population of 2000 and upwards and which already
had money-order offices. All other post offices were empowered to
receive telegrams, which were to be sent by post to the nearest
telegraph office for transmission. The charge was to be made uniform
at 1<i>s.</i> for twenty words and 6<i>d.</i> for each additional ten words,
or part thereof. He judged that the whole of the property and
rights of the telegraph companies might be purchased for a sum
within £2,400,000, and £100,000 more would have to be spent in
the extension of the service. His estimate for gross annual product
was £676,000; annual charge, £81,250; working expenses, £456,000;
surplus, £138,750.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Finally, his reply to Lord Stanley's
question was in effect that the telegraph system might be beneficially
worked by the Post Office, that there would be advantages
thus obtained over any system of private ownership, and that
the Post Office would have to bear no expense not amply covered
by the revenue.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> In fairness to Mr. Scudamore, it should be remembered
that his original low estimate of the probable cost of the
telegraph companies did not include Reuter's and other important
companies. In addition, the strict monopoly conferred in 1869,
with the necessary accompaniment of the purchase of all inland
telegraph companies, entirely upset his original estimates. Finally,
the decision to include the public telegraph business of the
railways and the excessive price paid to the railway and telegraph
companies should not be forgotten in contrasting the estimated
price with that eventually paid for the acquisition of the telegraph
systems in the United Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> Mr. Grimston, the Chairman
of the Electric and International Telegraph Company, contended
that the extension of telegraphic facilities to any considerable
number of small towns and villages would involve a loss to the
state by greatly increasing working expenses, that village postmasters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206">[206]</a></span>and postmistresses were totally unable to work the telegraphs,
and that consolidation could be effected more advantageously
by the companies themselves.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>In 1868, the Postmaster-General was given authority by act of
Parliament to purchase the undertakings of the telegraph companies
and also the interests of the railways in the conveyance
of public messages, together with a perpetual way-leave for telegraphic
purposes over the properties of the railway companies.
Any telegraph company, with the authority of two thirds of the
votes of its shareholders, was empowered to sell to the Postmaster-General
all or any portion of its undertaking. When the Postmaster-General
had acquired the property of any telegraph company,
he must also, upon the request of any other company, purchase
its undertaking, this privilege being extended also to the
railways so far as telegraphs operated by them for transmitting
public messages were concerned. The price paid for the Electric
and International, the British and Irish Magnetic, and the
United Kingdom Telegraph Companies was fixed at twenty years'
purchase of their net profits for the year ending 30th June,
1868. In the case of the United Kingdom Telegraph Company
additional sums were to be paid for the Hughes type-printing
patent, for the estimated aggregate value of its ordinary share
capital as determined by its highest quotation on any day between
the 1st and 25th days of June, 1868, for compensation for the loss
of prospective profits on its ordinary shares, and any sum that
might be determined as loss for its attempt to establish a uniform
shilling rate. Every officer or clerk of the companies who had been
in receipt of a salary for not less than five years or of remuneration
amounting to not less than £50 a year for not less than seven years,
if he received no offer from the Postmaster-General of an appointment
in the telegraphic department of the Post Office equal in the
opinion of an arbitrator to his former position, was entitled to
receive an annuity equal to two thirds of his annual emolument
if he had been in service twenty years, such annuity to be diminished
by one twentieth for every year less than twenty. Those
entering the service of the Postmaster-General were entitled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207">[207]</a></span>count their past continuous years of service with the companies
as years in the service of the Crown.</p>

<p>For the most part all the telegraph apparatus belonging to the
railway companies and all belonging to the telegraph companies
on the railway lines necessary for the private business of the railways
were handed over to the railways by the Postmaster-General
free of charge. He was given the use, from telegraph stations not
on the railway lines, of all the wires of the telegraph companies
on the lines employed exclusively in the public telegraph business.
The railways might affix wires to the posts of the Postmaster-General
on the line, and in like manner he might require the railways
to affix wires to their own posts for the use of the Post Office
or erect new posts and wires. Finally the railways were required
to act as agents of the Postmaster-General, if required, for receiving
and transmitting messages. The railways as a rule succeeded
in driving a very sharp bargain with the Government for the purchase
of their interests in the public telegraph business. The price
paid was twenty years' purchase of the net receipts from public
telegrams reckoned for the year ending 30th June, 1868, plus
twenty times the increase in net receipts for the three preceding
years or for such shorter period as the business of transmitting
public telegrams had been undertaken. In addition, compensation
was made for the rents, etc., payable to the railways by the telegraph
companies, for the unexpired period of their respective
agreements, for the right of way obtained by the Postmaster-General
over the lands of the railways, for the loss of power on the
part of the railways to grant way-leaves, for the value of the railways'
reversionary interests (if any) in the transmission of public
messages on the expiration of the agreements with the telegraph
companies, and for any loss the railways might suffer in working
their telegraph business as a separate concern. Finally the Postmaster-General
was required to convey free of charge to any part
of the United Kingdom all messages of the railways relating to
their own private business.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> The act empowering the Postmaster-General
to purchase the undertakings of the telegraph companies
did not confer upon the Post Office a monopoly in the transmission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208">[208]</a></span>of telegrams, Mr. Scudamore himself declaring that such a monopoly
was neither desirable nor did the Post Office wish it. The second
act, however, declared that no telegraphic messages, except
those sent from or to any place outside of the United Kingdom,
should be transmitted by any telegraphic company for gain unless
the company was in existence on the 22d of June, 1869, and was
not for the time being acquired by the Postmaster-General, who
should be required to purchase its undertaking upon demand.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore's original estimate of the cost of acquisition of
the telegraphs fell far short of the final expenditure; although it
must be remembered that, when he proposed £2,500,000 as sufficient,
he did not anticipate items of expense which later vastly
increased the cost. Before the committee which reported in 1868
he advanced his original estimate to £6,000,000, and in the following
year to £6,750,000, of which he considered about two thirds
to be of the nature of good-will. The telegraph companies when first
approached asked for twenty-five years' purchase of their prospective
profits, and the Government offered to buy at the highest price
realized on the Stock Exchange up to the 25th of May, with an
addition of from 10 to 15 per cent for compulsory sale. The cost
of the leading companies, based upon twenty years' purchase of
the net profits for the year ending 30th June, 1868, was as follows:
For the Electric and International, £2,933,826; for the British
and Irish Magnetic, £1,243,536; for Reuter's, £726,000; for the
United Kingdom Electric, £562,000; and for the Universal Private,
£184,421,&mdash;a total of £5,650,047. Separate bargains followed
with many smaller companies. The acts of 1868 and 1869 granted
£8,000,000, for the purpose of purchasing the undertakings of the
companies and the interests of the railways; £6,640,000 were spent
in purchases, and £1,560,000 in renewals and extensions between
1868 and 1872.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> The claims for compensation on the part of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209">[209]</a></span>of the railways were very excessive. The Lancashire and Yorkshire
Railway asked for £1,129,814, with interest, and £1 per wire per
mile a year for all wires erected upon its right of way by or for
the Post Office. By the terms of the award they obtained £169,197
and 1<i>s.</i> per mile per wire. The Great Eastern Railway presented a
claim for £412,608, with interest, and £1 per mile per wire. Their
claim was reduced to £73,315 and an annual payment of £200 for
way-leave. In all, the capital sum of £10,880,571 was expended
by the Government, necessitating an annual interest payment of
£326,417, charged, not on the Post Office vote, but on the Consolidated
Fund.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>When the Post Office acquired the telegraphs, a uniform rate was
introduced of 1<i>s.</i> for twenty words or part thereof and 3<i>d.</i> for each
additional five words or part thereof, exclusive of the names and
addresses of sender and receiver, which were transmitted free.
Delivery was free within a radius of one mile from the terminal
telegraphic office, or within the limit of the town postal delivery
when it contained a head office and the postal delivery extended
more than a mile from it. Beyond the above limits the charge did
not exceed 6<i>d.</i> per double mile or part thereof. When special delivery
was not required beyond the free delivery, the message was
sent free by the next ordinary postal delivery. The newspapers succeeded
in having incorporated within the act a clause prohibiting
a higher charge for press messages than 1<i>s.</i> for every one hundred
words transmitted between 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, or 1<i>s.</i> for every
seventy-five words between 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> when sent to a single
address, the charge for the transmission of the same telegram to each
additional address to be not greater than 2<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> On the day of transfer
the Post Office was able to open about a thousand postal telegraph
offices and nineteen hundred offices at railway stations where
the railways dealt with the public messages as agents of the Postmaster-General.
On the 31st of March, 1872, the system comprised
more than five thousand offices (including nineteen hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210">[210]</a></span>at railway stations), twenty-two thousand miles of line, with an
aggregate of eighty-three thousand miles of wire, and more than
six thousand instruments. A decided increase in the number of
messages was the result. During the first year after the transfer
there were nearly ten millions of messages, the second year twelve
millions, and the third year fifteen millions, or more than double
the number transmitted in 1869. The period from 1872 to the
adoption of a sixpenny tariff in 1885 was one of steady progress.
The number of new offices opened was not numerous, the increase
having been only one thousand, but the improvements in existing
connections were marked and the number of messages transmitted
had increased to thirty-three millions. The new tariff rate was 6<i>d.</i>
for twelve words or less, with a halfpenny for each additional word,
but the old system of free addresses was abolished. Under the old
tariff each figure was charged at a single rate. Under the new
schedule five figures were counted as one word. A large proportion
of telegrams were brought within the minimum sixpenny rate,
while the average charge, which had been 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> in 1885, was
reduced to 8<i>d.</i> in 1886. The number of messages increased from
thirty-three millions in 1884-85 to fifty millions in 1886-87. Four
cables between France and England and one between France and
the Jersey Isles were purchased by the governments of the two
countries, two by the Belgian and English governments, two between
Holland and England, and one between Germany and England,
by the governments of the countries interested.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>Following the adoption of a uniform sixpenny rate the department
has granted other facilities to the public, which, though popular
enough, have undoubtedly tended to place the working of the
telegraphs upon a less secure financial basis. In 1889, the issue of
telegraphic money orders was begun as an experiment, and in the
same year was extended to all head and branch post offices in the
United Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> Two years later the Post Office ceased to require
the repayment of the capital outlay on telegraph extensions
made under guarantee, and the rural sanitary authorities were
empowered to defray the cost of such extensions in places within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211">[211]</a></span>their districts.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> For the six preceding years the average annual
number of guaranteed telegraph offices was seventy-seven, and during
the next five years the average annual number increased to 167.
As part of the Jubilee concessions in 1897, the guarantors were
required to pay only one half of the deficiency, with the result that
during the following two years the average annual number of
guaranteed telegraphic offices increased to 290. At the same time
the free delivery limit was extended to three miles and a reduction
was granted in the porterage charges beyond that distance. Finally,
in 1905, the guarantee was reduced to one third of the loss
incurred, the delivery charge being fixed at 3<i>d.</i> a mile for the distance
beyond the three-mile limit, instead of the distance from the
office of delivery.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p>In 1896, the main routes from London having become crowded,
especially by the telephone trunk lines, the principle of underground
lines between the most important centres was sanctioned
by the department. London and Birmingham were first connected,
and the line was ultimately extended through Stafford to Warrington,
where it joined existing underground wires between Manchester,
Liverpool, and Chester. By 1905, underground wires were
laid as far north as Glasgow through Carlisle, to be extended later
to Edinburgh. At Manchester a junction was effected with a line
passing through Bradford to Leeds. During the same year underground
lines were completed from London to Chatham and from
London westward toward Bristol, with the intention of extending it
into Cornwall in order to secure communication with the Atlantic
and Mediterranean cables.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>In 1875, England joined the other important European powers
in a telegraphic agreement which went into effect in January of
the following year. By this agreement each of the contracting
parties agreed to devote special wires to international service,
government telegrams to have precedence in transmission and to
be forwarded in code if desired. Private telegrams could also be
sent in code between those countries which allowed them, and the
<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>signatory powers agreed to pass them in transit, but each country
reserved to itself the privilege of stopping any private telegram.
For the purpose of making charges, any country might be divided
into not more than two zones, and each of the signatory powers
owed to the others an account of charges collected.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> So far as foreign
telegrams were concerned, the use of manufactured expressions
in place of real words gave rise to considerable trouble in
view of the fact that such combinations were difficult to transmit.
In 1879, the languages which might be used for code words were
reduced by common consent to English, French, German, Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and Latin. At the same time the use
of proper names as code words was prohibited. This did not remove
the evil, as the roots of words in one language with terminations
in another were used. An official vocabulary was compiled by the
International Telegraph Bureau, to become obligatory in 1898,
but its publication in 1894 aroused considerable opposition, as
many of the words were dangerously alike, and in 1896 the decision
of the Paris Conference of 1890, by which the official vocabulary
was to become compulsory for European telegrams in 1898, was
rescinded. It was also decided that an enlarged vocabulary should
be published by the International Bureau, but, owing to the action
of the English delegates, the official vocabulary was not made
compulsory at the meeting of the International Telegraph Conference
in 1903, although artificial words were allowed if pronounceable
in accordance with the usages of any one of the eight languages
from which the ordinary code words might be selected. It was also
decided to admit letter cipher at the rate of five letters to a word,
and several countries agreed to lower their charges for the transmission
of extra-European telegrams, the English delegates contending
that the rates for such telegrams should be made the same
as the rates for European telegrams.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> In 1878, negotiations with
the German and Netherland Telegraph Administrations resulted
in a charge of 4<i>d.</i> a word being fixed as the rate between the United
Kingdom and Germany and 3<i>d.</i> a word between the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1885, the following reductions in rates were announced:&mdash;</p>

<p>
To Russia  from 9<i>d.</i> to  6&#189;<i>d.</i> a word.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Spain&nbsp;  6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&#189;<i>d.</i></span><br />

<p>to be followed six years later by still greater reductions:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>the minimum charge for a telegram being 10<i>d.</i> in all cases. The
transmission of foreign money orders by telegraph was inaugurated
in 1898 by the opening of an exchange with Germany and
its extension shortly afterward to the other important European
countries.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p>In 1892, an attempt was made, curiously suggestive of Marconi's
discovery, to transmit telegraph messages without a direct wire.
The experiment was conducted between the island of Flat Holm
in the Bristol Channel and the mainland, a distance of three miles.
A wire was erected on the mainland parallel with one on the island,
and, by means of strong vibratory currents sent through the former,
signals were transmitted and messages exchanged. Three years
later and before the practical value of the Flat Holm experiment
had been substantiated, Mr. Marconi arrived in England to submit
his plans to the Post Office. A private wire from Poldhu to
Falmouth was provided for him on the usual rental terms, and it
was announced that the Post Office would act as his agent for collecting
messages to be transmitted by wireless telegraphy when he
had proved the feasibility of his project. At the international congress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214">[214]</a></span>on wireless telegraphy held in Berlin in 1903 it was recommended
that shore stations equipped with wireless apparatus
should be bound to exchange messages with ships at sea without
regard to the system of wireless telegraphy employed by the latter,
that the rate of charge for the shore station should be subject to
the approval of the state where it was situated, the rate of the ship
to the approval of the state whose flag it carried, and that the
working of wireless stations should be regulated so as to interfere
with other stations as little as possible. In order to enable the
Government to carry out the decision of the congress and to place
wireless telegraphy under its control for strategic purposes, an act
was passed in 1904 making it illegal to instal or work wireless telegraphic
apparatus in the United Kingdom or on board a British
ship in territorial waters without the licence of the Postmaster-General.
The act was to be operative for two years only, but
before its expiration, was extended until the 31st of December,
1909, before which it might again be renewed. Arrangements
were also made for the collection and delivery of the telegrams of
the Marconi Company by the post offices throughout the country.
The company charges its usual rate, 6<i>d.</i>. a word, and the Post
Office in addition charges the ordinary inland rate.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> The international
agreement providing for compulsory communication between
shore stations and ships was signed in 1906 in spite of the protests
of the Marconi Company, Sir Edward Sassoon, and others, who
contended that the agreement was unfair to the company and a
mistake on the part of the Kingdom, "which was thus giving up advantages
obtained by the possession of the best system of wireless
telegraphy in the world." The majority of the countries represented
were also in favour of compulsory communication between ship
and ship, but this was successfully negatived by Great Britain and
Japan. In 1908, Mr. Buxton was able to announce in the House
that the relations between the Post Office and the Marconi Company
"are now of the most friendly kind," and that they have
accepted and adopted the principle of intercommunication. In the
preceding year two experimental stations were started by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215">[215]</a></span>Government which will enable the department to extend its operations
quite independently of the companies.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>From a financial point of view, government ownership and control
of the telegraphs in the United Kingdom has not been a success.
In addition, the Telegraph Department, for some time previous
to 1874, had been drawing upon the balance in the possession
of the Post Office, a balance which was required to be invested
for other purposes and whose expenditure for the use of the telegraphs
had not been authorized by Parliament. Mr. Goldsmid,
in introducing a motion for the appointment of a committee of
enquiry, alluded to this error on the part of the department, to the
excessive price paid for the telegraphs, and complained that the
telegraph system was not being operated on a paying basis. His
motion was withdrawn, but an agreement was reached with the
department by the appointment of a committee, with Mr. Playfair
as chairman, "to inquire into the organization and financial system
of the Telegraph Department of the Post Office." The committee
in their report commented unfavourably upon the unnecessarily
large force, the cumbrous organization, and the far from
economical management of some of the divisions of the department,
advised that an attempt be made to remedy these faults, and that
press messages be charged a minimum rate of 1<i>s.</i> each, and not
at the rate of 1<i>s.</i> for each seventy-five or one hundred words obtained
by adding together separate messages requiring separate
transmission. This suggestion with reference to press messages was
adopted, promises were made at the same time to diminish the
force, and a scheme was submitted for the reorganization of the
department.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p>The number of telegrams for the year ending 31st March, 1887,
the year following the sixpenny reduction, was 50,243,639; for the
year 1891-92 it had increased to 69,685,480. In 1896-97 the number
was 79,423,556 and in 1899-1900 the total was 90,415,123.
During the next three years there was a reduction, followed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216">[216]</a></span>1902-03 by an increase to 92,471,000. Since 1902-03 the number
has again fallen off, the figures for 1906-07 being only 89,493,000.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>
It is rather difficult to make definite statements about the telegraph
finances on account of the lack of uniformity in presenting the accounts
since 1870. Under gross revenue is now included the value
of services done for other departments, but this was not always the
rule. The expenditure of other departments for the telegraph service
may or may not be included under ordinary telegraphic expenditure.
Net revenue may also be increased or a deficit changed to
a surplus by deducting the expenditure for sites, buildings, and extensions
from ordinary expenditure. Finally, the interest on capital
is not charged on the Telegraph Vote, and so is not included
under expenditure. In 1871, 1880, and 1881 there seem to have
been surpluses over all expenditure, including interest on capital.
Excluding interest from expenditure, the net revenue decreased
from £303,457 in 1871 to £59,732 in 1875, when the pensions to
officials of the telegraph companies were first charged to the Telegraph
Vote. With an increased net revenue of £245,116 in 1876,
following the report of the committee of investigation, the department
did very well from a financial point of view, until 1884,
when the net revenue fell to £51,255, and in 1887 there was a deficit
of £84,078, due to the fact that expenses were increasing at a
greater rate than receipts. The sixpenny reduction seems to have
made but little change in the financial situation, the gross revenue
increasing from £1,755,118 in 1884-85 to £1,855,686 in 1886-87,
the expenditure for the same years being £1,731,040 and £1,939,734.
The net revenue began to recover in 1888-89, and averaged
about £150,000 a year during the four years ending March 31,
1892. During the fiscal years 1894 and 1895 there were deficits,
then a slight recovery from 1896 to 1900 and a succession of deficits
from 1901 to 1905. The interest on stock, £214,500 in 1870,
increased steadily to £326,417 in 1880, at which figure it remained
until 1889, when a reduction in the rate of interest from 3 per cent
to 2-3/4 per cent lowered the amount payable to £299,216. In 1903,
there was a further reduction to £278,483.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p>The financial loss experienced by the Government in operating
the telegraphs has naturally produced considerable interest in this
phase of the question. Mr. Blackwood, the Financial Secretary of
the Post Office, in his evidence before the committee, considered
that the financial control and oversight of the department were inadequate
and that the department was over-manned. On the other
hand, he was of the opinion that many expenses were met by revenue
expenditure which should have been charged to capital. Mr.
Baines, the Surveyor-General, among other causes of the financial
deficiency, called attention to the shorter hours and longer
annual leave of the telegraph staff as government employees, the
higher standard of efficiency established by the Post Office, and the
prevalence of much overtime work as a result of the maintenance
by the companies, just before the transfer, of an inadequate staff.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
The fact that the yearly increase in messages continued to diminish
after 1879 is commented on by the Postmaster-General in 1884 as
due to the stagnation of trade, the competition of the telephones,
and the rapidity of the letter post. Mr. Raikes called attention to
the large number of telegrams on the business of the railways which
were transmitted for nothing. By an agreement with several of the
railway companies to send, as a right instead of a privilege, a fixed
number of messages containing a fixed number of words, this increase
was checked. In 1892, the following comment is found in
the Postmaster-General's Report: "This stagnation of business,
viewed in connection with an increased cost in working expenses,
is a matter for serious consideration, and necessarily directs attention
to that part of the business which is conducted at a loss," the
reference being to the increased number of press messages transmitted
at a nominal charge. When in 1868 the newspaper proprietors
succeeded in obtaining the insertion in the Telegraph Act
of special rates for the transmission of press messages, no condition
was laid down that copies, in order that they might be sent at the
very low charges there enumerated, should be transmitted to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218">[218]</a></span>same place as the original telegram. The newspapers combined to
receive messages from news associations in identical terms, and,
by dividing the cost, obtained a rate equal on the average to 4&#189; <i>d.</i>
per hundred words. Under the arrangements adopted for the transmission
of news messages the number of words so sent did not
necessitate a corresponding amount of work, but it is an interesting
fact that in 1895 the number of words dealt with for the press
formed two fifths of the total number. In that year the loss on
these telegrams was estimated at about £300,000 a year. The high
price paid as purchase money is another of the factors to be considered,
only in so far, however, as the Telegraphic Department
has failed to meet the interest on the debt so incurred. The telegraph
companies were very liberally treated, and in certain cases
excessive prices were undoubtedly paid. Probably the most important
reason for the financial failure of the telegraphs under
government ownership and control has been the influence of forces
productive of good in themselves, but quite different from those
which had previously been dominant when the telegraphs were
under private control and during the early years of government
management. The effect of these forces is clearly seen in the
reduction of the tariff in 1885, the extension of facilities under
inadequate guarantee, and the increase in the pay of the staff.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
Mr. Buxton is of the opinion that the worst feature of the postal
business is the telegraph service. "It has never been profitable and
now the telephone system has so largely taken its place that the
revenue is falling off," while the "Economist" considers that "it is
obvious that both in the Savings Bank and the Telegraph branches
reforms are urgently needed in order to place matters on a sound
financial basis."<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center"><b>THE POST OFFICE AND THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES</b></p>


<p>The first telephone brought to England by Lord Kelvin in 1876
was a very crude instrument, useful only for experimental purposes
and of interest only as a forecast of later development. In the
following year two Post Office officials introduced some machines
which had been presented to them by the American inventor Bell,
and although not very efficient, they were of some commercial use.
The Post Office made arrangements with the agents of the inventor
for the purpose of supplying its private wire renters with these machines
if they should wish to make use of them. With the invention
of the microphone in 1878, and its application to the telephone,
a thoroughly practical method of transmitting speech was at last
introduced. In the same year a company was formed to acquire
and work the Bell patents. They endeavoured to come to an agreement
with the Post Office by which the latter might obtain telephones
at cost price, and would in return facilitate the operations
of the company, but the negotiations came to nothing. There was
then no suggestion of an exchange system, and the company proposed
merely to supply telephones and wires to private individuals.
In 1879, the Edison Telephone Company of London was established,
an announcement having been made in the autumn of 1878
that it was proposed to establish exchanges. An attempt was made
to amend the Telegraph Act so as to confer specifically upon the
department monopolistic control over telephonic communication,
but the amendment failed to receive the sanction of the House of
Commons. The Postmaster-General then filed information against
both companies, on the ground that the transmission of messages
by telephone was an infringement of the telegraphic monopoly.
In the summer of 1880 the two companies amalgamated as the
United Telephone Company, and in December judgment was given
by the High Court of Justice in favour of the Post Office.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>In April of 1881 the Postmaster-General granted the United
Telephone Company a licence to establish and operate a telephone
system within a five-mile radius in London, the central point to be
chosen by the company. On the other hand the company agreed
to pay a royalty of 10 per cent of its gross receipts and to accept
the judgment of the High Court. Licences were also granted to establish
telephone exchanges in the provincial towns within a radius
of one or two miles, all the licences to expire in 1911. The Postmaster-General
reserved the right to establish exchanges for the
department and the option of purchasing the works of the licencees
in 1890 or at seven-year intervals from 1890, six months' notice
having first been given. The policy of the United Telephone Company
was to confine its own operations to London and to allow
patent apparatus to be used in other parts of the country by
subsidiary companies, leaving them free to negotiate with the
Post Office for provincial licences.</p>

<p>The telephone policy of the Post Office from 1880 to 1884 consisted
in the granting of licences to the companies in restricted
areas, so that the telegraph revenue might suffer from competition
as little as possible, and the establishment by the department of
exchanges in certain places not as a rule served by the companies.
Owing to the refusal of the Government to solicit business, their
exchanges did not prove a success. The department itself would
probably have preferred to take over the whole telephone business
in 1880, but this policy met with no favour from the Lords of the
Treasury, who were of the opinion "that the state, as regards all
functions which are not by their nature exclusively its own, should
at most be ready to supplement, not endeavour to supersede private
enterprise, and that a rough but not inaccurate test of the legitimacy
of its procedure is not to act in anticipation of possible demands."
The operation by the government of the unimportant
exchanges possessed by them was sanctioned by their Lordships,
"on the understanding that its object is by the establishment of a
telephonic system to a limited extent by the Post Office to enable
your department to negotiate with the telephone companies in a
satisfactory manner for licences." The London and Globe Company
was given a licence in 1882 to establish exchanges in London, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221">[221]</a></span>
they were entirely dependent upon the United Company for instruments,
so that there was no real competition. The department proceeded
to issue licences for the establishment of competing systems
in places where there were already government exchanges. From
1880 to 1884 the Postmaster-General granted twenty-three licences,
and some twenty-seven towns, with 1141 subscribers, were
served by the department. The policy of the Post Office during
these years, as thus outlined, was far from satisfactory to the
public, due largely to the desire to protect the telegraph revenue,
and the failure to appreciate the possibilities which the new system
of communication was capable of offering. The companies, restricted
as they were to local areas, could not offer any means for
communication between these areas, since special permission had
to be obtained for the erection of trunk lines. The Government
offered to provide these on condition that a direct payment of £10
a mile per double wire and one half the revenue over that sum
should be paid for their use, but this offer the companies
naturally refused to consider. The Lancashire and Cheshire Company
proposed to fix their trunk-line charges so low as to pay
expenses only, but they were informed by the Government that
they must charge 10s. a mile annual rental. In addition, they were
not allowed to charge less than 1<i>s.</i> at their call offices, the then prevailing
fee for a telegram. A few trunk lines, it is true, were constructed
by the Government and rented to the companies, but they
were quite insufficient to satisfy the demand. In London, the United
Telephone Company was not allowed to extend its system beyond
the five-mile radius without special permission and the payment of
an increased royalty. In addition, the companies had no way-leave
powers, but had to depend upon the good will of householders to
fly their wires from house-top to house-top, with the result that
in London there was a ridiculously large number of exchanges.
Finally the companies were restricted to connecting subscribers
with the exchange or their place of business, and, although messages
could be telephoned for further transmission by the telegraphs,
there was not that close connection between the telephonic
and telegraphic systems which might eventually have led to the
mutual advantage of each. Moreover, in 1882, the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222">[222]</a></span>
announced that they would grant no more licences unless the subsidiary
companies agreed to sell to them all the instruments they
wished, the intention probably being for the Government to supply
instruments to companies which would establish exchanges in
real competition with the United Telephone Company. Since the
subsidiary companies could not supply these instruments without
the consent of the parent company, the only result was still further
to restrict telephonic development.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p>In 1884, the prevailing public discontent in connection with the
Government's treatment of the situation manifested itself in the
press and in the House of Commons. The Post Office was accused
of practising a policy of strangulation toward the companies, and
the Postmaster-General, Mr. Fawcett, acknowledged that there
was some truth in the charge. He advised the Treasury that the
companies' areas of operation should be unlimited, and that their
operations should be confined to the transmission of oral communications.
The restricted licences were withdrawn and new, unrestricted
licences granted, terminable in 1911 with the same qualifications
with reference to royalties and government purchase that
were inserted in the old licences. Nominally the result produced
free competition, but actually competition was impossible until the
expiration of the fundamental patents in 1892. The year before
their expiration, the companies succeeded in getting control of the
situation by an amalgamation of the United Telephone Company
with its licencees under the name of the National Telephone Company.
Mr. Dickinson, Deputy Chairman of the London County
Council, stated that the nominal capital of the United Telephone
Company, £900,000 (with an actual capital expenditure in 1887
within the Metropolitan District of £228,180) was taken over
by the National Telephone Company at a cost of £1,484,375, and
the Duke of Marlborough said in the House of Lords that of the
£3,250,000 capital of the new company over £2,000,000 was
"water." Mr. Raikes, the Postmaster-General, who was in favour
of competition, wrote to the United Company, disapproving of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223">[223]</a></span>whole transaction. With the expiration of the patent rights, the
New Telephone Company was resuscitated, with the Duke of
Marlborough as chairman, an agreement having been concluded
with the Telephone Subscribers' Protective Association for a
twelve guineas' service in London, but it in turn was absorbed by
the National Company, much to the disgust of the members of the
Association. So far as way-leave rights were concerned the position
of the companies remained in a very unsatisfactory condition.
A committee of the House of Commons advised that certain way-leave
rights should be granted, but nothing was accomplished,
although a bill was introduced in the House of Commons in 1885
to enable the companies to erect posts without the consent of the
road authorities.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Forbes, the chairman of the National Telephone Company,
said to the Committee of 1892: "I am prepared to concede that
the telephone company which conducts about 93 or 94 per cent
of the whole telephonic business of the country conducts a great
deal of it monstrously badly, but it is not their fault, it is the fault
of Parliament"; and again in referring to the lack of way-leave
power: "Take London for instance; London is very badly served,
but why is it very badly served? Because everything depends
upon the caprice of the individual." As a result of the complaints
that the telephone system was giving an inadequate service
because of the high rates on an inflated capital, because the
utility of the telephones was impaired in that they could not be
used in connection with the telegraph and postal services, and because
of the lack of powers to erect poles in the streets or to lay
underground wires or to connect their exchanges by trunk lines,
the Government announced a change of policy in 1892.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> This
change was set forth in a Treasury Minute of the 23d of May,
1892, and in two memoranda of agreement of the same year to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224">[224]</a></span>which the National and the New Companies were respectively
parties, the arrangements being sanctioned by Parliament in the
Telegraph acts of 1892 and 1896. So far as it affected the National
Company the arrangement was embodied in detail in an agreement
dated the 25th of March, 1896, no similar agreement being made
with the New Company because that company went into liquidation
in 1892, and in 1896 surrendered its licence. By the agreement
of 1896 the National Telephone Company surrendered its previous
licence except for certain definite districts called "Exchange Areas,"
a large number of which were specified in the agreement. These
areas were as a rule coterminous with the urban districts, but comprised
in addition certain areas made up of two or more urban districts
together with the intervening country. Power was reserved
to the Postmaster-General to specify other exchange areas, the
understanding being, both with regard to areas already specified
and those to be specified, that industrial areas of wide extent
should be recognized in cases where there were no considerable
towns forming centres of business, that neighbouring towns intimately
connected in their business relations should be placed in the
same area, and that small towns and villages should also be so
grouped when each by itself would not pay. Outside these areas
the Postmaster-General alone was entitled to carry on telephone
business, no more licences being granted for the whole Kingdom,
and for any particular town only with the approval of the corporation
or municipal authority. Call offices for the use of the public
were to be opened at the company's exchanges and connected
with the post offices in order that exchange subscribers might telephone
over the trunk lines to exchange subscribers in other towns.
Where intercommunication took place between the systems of the
company and the Post Office, a terminal charge on the part of the
receiving system was allowed. Telephonic messages could be sent
to the post offices for transmission as telegrams and delivery as such
or for delivery as letters. Express messengers could also be sent for
by telephone, and telegrams received at the post offices might be
transmitted by telephone.</p>

<p>The Postmaster-General was authorized to grant to the company
all such powers of executing works within its exchange areas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225">[225]</a></span>
(other than works under, over, or along any railway or canal) as
were conferred upon him by the Telegraph acts of 1863, 1878, and
Section 2 of the act of 1892. If required by the company, he must
provide underground wires between different exchanges in the
same exchange area, and must allow the company to conclude
agreements with railway and canal companies over whose property
he had exclusive right of way. In exchange for these privileges
the company agreed to sell its trunk lines to the Postmaster-General,
their value being fixed at a later date at £459,114, which
amount was paid to the company on the 4th of April, 1895, the
length of trunk line taken over being 2651 miles having 29,000
miles of wire. In order to remove a serious handicap to the success
of competing companies, the trunk lines were henceforth to be controlled
and extended by the Post Office, the company to receive
five per cent of any gross charges for trunk-line tolls which it might
collect as an agent of the Post Office. The rates charged by the
Post Office for trunk-line conversations in 1896 were, for distances
of 125 miles and under, the same as those previously charged by
the company, and were lower than the old rates for distances in
excess of 125 miles.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time there was evidence of considerable opposition
to the practical monopoly of the company within the exchange areas.
A motion introduced in the House of Commons by Doctor Cameron,
member of Parliament for Glasgow, in favour of government
purchase of the telephones, received considerable support, but was
rejected by the Government on the ground that the resulting increase
in the number of civil servants, not paid at market wages
and constantly trying to bring pressure to bear on members, was
too serious an evil to receive the sanction of the Government.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
The claim was also made by some of the towns and by Glasgow in
particular that the municipalities should be allowed to install their
own telephone systems in opposition to those of the company. A
select committee was appointed to consider this demand on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226">[226]</a></span>
question of "whether the provision made for telephone service in
local areas is adequate, and whether it is advisable to grant licences
to local authorities or otherwise," but, owing to the dissolution of
Parliament, the committee did not present a report. Considerable
evidence was heard, however, and the committee recommended
that another committee should be appointed during the next session
to consider and report upon the evidence already taken and,
if necessary, take more evidence. The witnesses examined were as a
rule of the opinion that the telephones should be taken over by the
state; but there was a difference of opinion as to whether municipal
licences should be granted. Dissatisfaction with existing conditions
seemed to be widespread. The Glasgow Corporation expressed disgust
with the service of the company on account of the difficulty
of getting into communication with subscribers, frequent interruptions
and noises, and the chance of being overheard by a third
party, the first complaint being due in their opinion to inadequate
exchange accommodations, the second and third to the one-wire
system. The corporation was accused on the other hand of attempting
to dislocate the company's system by refusing them permission
to lay underground wires, while the overhead wires were
unfavourably affected by the electric tramway currents. The Deputy
Town Clerk of Liverpool was in favour of government telephones,
but opposed municipal licences on the ground that they
would increase the expense of telephoning between a municipal
exchange and one belonging to the company. The London County
Council advised that severe restrictions should be laid upon the
company by imposing maximum rates, etc., or that the state should
take over the company's system or that the municipality should
do so. Questions were sent to subscribers in London by the County
Council, by the company, and by the Commissioner of Sewers, asking
for their opinion on the service rendered by the company
there. As may be imagined, the replies sent to the County Council
and the Commissioner were on the whole unfavourable to the company,
while those sent to the company were generally favourable
to them. It was shown that the number of subscribers in English
and Scotch cities was fewer than in most continental cities, and
that, comparing the population of the United Kingdom with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227">[227]</a></span>
of the United States, the number of subscribers in the former
should be about 145,000 instead of about 50,000; but nothing was
said of the superior postal and telegraphic facilities of the United
Kingdom as compared with the majority of foreign countries,
facilities which would naturally reduce the demand for a comparatively
new and in many cases unpopular method of communication.
The rate of the company in the Metropolitan area for a
business connection was £20 for a yearly agreement, with substantial
reductions for second and additional connections, and £12
for private houses. On a five years' agreement the rates were £17
and £10 respectively. The rate in Paris at the same time was £16.
For the provincial cities in England, such as Manchester, Liverpool,
etc., the rate was £10 for a first connection and £8 10<i>s.</i>
for second and additional connections, and for the large towns,
such as Norwich, Chester, Exeter, etc., £8 within half a mile of the
exchange, £9 within three quarters of a mile, £10 within one mile,
and an additional £2 10<i>s.</i> for each additional half-mile, with reductions
for extra connections. For small outlying and isolated
towns the half-mile rate was £6 10<i>s.</i>, one mile £8, and £2 10<i>s.</i> for
every additional half-mile.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>In 1898, another committee was appointed with Mr. Hanbury
as chairman, "to enquire and report whether the telephone service
was calculated to become of such general benefit as to justify its
being undertaken by municipal and other authorities, regard being
had to local finance." The committee were of the opinion that the
existing telephone system was not of general benefit either in the
kingdom at large or in those portions where exchanges existed, that
it could hardly be of benefit so long as monopolistic conditions existed,
and that it was capable of becoming much more useful if
worked solely or mainly with a view to the public interest. They
condemned the flat rate subscription charge of the company as of
benefit only to the wealthier commercial classes in English cities.
They commented unfavourably upon the fact that in the London
area there were only 237 call offices open to non-subscribers, and
that as a rule messages could not be sent from them to subscribers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228">[228]</a></span>except when the sender and recipient were in the same postal district
or town, when the message might be delivered. They were of
the opinion that the telephones were far more useful in other countries
where the conditions were not so favourable. Conditions,
they thought, were unlikely to improve under the present management.
The company must pay dividends on an inflated capital;
its licence would expire in 1911, and the Government was hardly
likely to pay the company at that date for goodwill. In addition,
there were no restrictions on charges, the company had a motive
for limiting its subscribers, as expenses increased proportionately
with an increase in their number, and the question of way-leaves
was a source of great difficulty. Finally, they declared in favour
of competition by the municipalities and the Post Office as tending
to reduce rates, extend the system, and, if the Government should
eventually purchase the telephones, give alternative systems to
choose from. The Government adopted the committee's report,
and, in a Treasury Minute of the 8th of May, 1899, laid down
the principles upon which licences should be granted by the
Postmaster-General to the municipalities, and announced that
in London the Postmaster-General would himself establish an
exchange system.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>In accordance with the finding of the committee and the resulting
Treasury Minute, an act was passed in 1899, conferring upon
the boroughs and borough districts to which the Postmaster-General
might grant licences the right to borrow money upon the
security of the rates for the erection and management of telephone
systems. A loan of £2,000,000 was authorized for the use of the
department itself in establishing telephone competition with the
company in London. The act also defined the relations between
the company and the municipalities (or other new licencees) in
the event of competition. If the telephone company would agree
to abandon the power of discriminating between subscribers and
would consent to limit their charges within the maxima and
minima prescribed by the Postmaster-General, the latter was to
extend any way-leave rights already possessed for the period of
the licence granted to the competing municipality or new licencee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p>If the new licence were extended beyond 1911, the company's
licence would be likewise extended, but if their licence were extended
for as much as eight years beyond 1911, the company
were bound, at the request of the licencee and under certain conditions,
to grant interchange of communication within the area.
The new licences would be granted only to local authorities or
companies approved by them, and the National Company was prohibited
from opening exchanges in any area in which they had not,
before the passing of the act, established an effective exchange.
The effect of the act was to limit competition to the municipalities,
to confine the National Company to those towns and areas they
were already serving, and to throw upon the Postmaster-General
the duty of serving other parts of the country.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>The form of the licences for municipalities, among other conditions,
contained provisions designed to secure for the public an
efficient and cheap service. It was provided that the plant should
be constructed in accordance with specifications prepared by the
Postmaster-General, no preferential treatment should be allowed
to any subscriber, the charges made should be within certain specified
limits, neither the licence nor any part of the plant of the
licencee should be assigned to or amalgamated with the business
of any other licencee, and that the licence might be terminated
if an exchange system were not established within two years. The
provisions of the agreement of 1896 which secured coöperation between
the Post Office and the National Company and combined
the telephone with the telegraph and postal services were also
introduced into the municipal licences. The municipalities were
bound to give intercommunication between their exchanges and
any established by the Postmaster-General, and terminal charges
for trunk-wire communications between the exchange subscribers
of any other system and those of the local authority were forbidden.
About sixty local authorities made enquiries with a view
to taking out licences, but only thirteen licences were accepted.
That of Tunbridge Wells was surrendered in 1903, owing to an
agreement arrived at between the National Telephone Company
and the corporation, the municipal telephones not having proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230">[230]</a></span>a success.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> In the case of seven others the licences were surrendered
or cancelled. The following corporations held licences in
1905:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Hull licence terminating 31st December, 1911<br />
Glasgow                                 1913<br />
Swansea                                 1920<br />
Brighton                 30th April,    1926<br />
Portsmouth                              1926<br />
</p>

<p>In all the above cases except Hull, the National Telephone Company
had agreed to forego the granting of special favours to subscribers,
had established intercommunication, and their licence was
accordingly extended in those places to the dates of termination
of the corporation licences. In Glasgow the National Telephone
Company made several applications for permission to lay underground
wires, but the corporation refused the concession on any
terms. In spite of this advantage and the inability of the company
to meet the low unlimited user rate of the corporation telephones on
account of agreements with subscribers in other towns, the corporation
found it advisable to sell its plant to the Post Office in 1906
for £305,000 at a capital loss of between £12,000 and £15,000.
Brighton followed suit a little later for the sum of £49,000, at
a loss of £2450. Swansea experienced considerable difficulty in
borrowing money to extend its system on account of the refusal
of the Local Government Board to grant the necessary borrowing
powers. The Post Office offered £22,000 for a plant which had cost
£27,173. This offer was refused by the corporation, and an agreement
was concluded with the National Telephone Company in 1907 for
the sale of the plant at a price sufficient to repay the whole capital.
Offers were also made to Hull and Portsmouth by the department,
but were refused, as they were not sufficiently high to cover expenditure.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>As a rule the local authorities offered an initial flat rate lower
than that paid by the company's subscribers in competing centres,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231">[231]</a></span>but most of the other rates of the corporation authorities were
somewhat higher. The service offered by the public telephones was
not so satisfactory as had been hoped, and the more numerous connections
open to the company's subscribers formed an initial advantage
which it was difficult to overcome. On the other hand, the
corporations often had the advantage of underground connections
which were denied to the company, but the relatively small
number of the subscribers of the corporation telephones, the high
cost of underground connections, the clumsy service offered in many
cases, and the ability of the company to offer lower rates in competitive
areas proved too much for most of the corporations which
were granted licences.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime the National Telephone Company had been
experiencing considerable difficulty in getting permission to lay
underground wires in London. In 1892, the Telegraph act of that
year authorized the Postmaster-General to grant to his licencees the
same way-leave powers which he enjoyed, subject to the conditions
that the licencees should not exercise such powers in London without
the consent of the County Council, nor in any urban district
outside London without the consent of the urban authority, nor
elsewhere without the consent of the County Council. In pursuance
of this authority the Postmaster-General, in the agreement of the
25th of March, 1896, undertook, at the request of the company,
to authorize them to exercise his way-leave powers in any exchange
area. The company did not apply for the exercise of such authority
in London, but an attempt was made by them to obtain the
consent of the London County Council to allow their wires to be
placed underground, and the work proceeded with the permission
of the local road authorities in London. Negotiations with the
council were fruitless, largely on account of the price asked for
way-leave and the demand for lower rates. The Postmaster-General
was advised that it was his duty to see that the act of 1892
was enforced, and the resulting correspondence with the company
having failed of any satisfactory result, an information in the name
of the Attorney-General was filed against the company, asking for
a declaration that they were not entitled to proceed with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232">[232]</a></span>underground works in London without the authority of the Postmaster-General
and the consent of the County Council. An order
to that effect was made on the 24th of July, 1900. This seemed a
favourable opportunity for the Postmaster-General to secure from
the company certain concessions with reference to their London
exchange system as well as privileges for the subscribers of the
postal exchanges which had been established in London and an
agreement with reference to the purchase in 1911 by the Post
Office of the company's London exchanges. These concessions
and privileges were finally embodied in an agreement made on the
18th of November, 1901, by which the Postmaster-General agreed
to furnish such underground wires on the demand of the company
as he might think reasonable and likely to be useful to the Post
Office later, as well as underground wires connecting the exchanges
of the Post Office with those of the company. When the subscribers
of the London Postal Exchanges exceeded 10,000 in number, the
company agreed to pay half of the rent of the latter wires. No
terminal charges were payable for a message passing over these
wires, or for a message over the trunk lines between the subscribers
of the Post Office in London and those outside London, or between
subscribers of the company in London and those outside
London. In addition, the Postmaster-General promised to afford
to the company's subscribers in London all such facilities with
reference to postal, telegraphic, and telephonic communications
as he granted to Post Office London subscribers and upon the
same terms and conditions. He also agreed to consider all applications
from the company for way-leaves on railways and canals
where he enjoyed such rights, and the company promised to
establish telephone communications without favour or preference.
A decision was also reached fixing equal rates for the postal
and company's subscribers in London, based primarily on the
number of messages sent with an unmeasured rate lower than that
previously in force, no revision to be made without six months'
notice being given. Finally it was agreed that in 1911 or before&mdash;if
the company's licence should have been previously revoked&mdash;the
Postmaster-General should buy and the company should sell at its
fair market value all such plant as should then be in use by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233">[233]</a></span>
company in London and be suitable for the Post Office at that date.
None of the plant was to be considered suitable unless installed
with the written consent of the Postmaster-General, the question
of suitability to be decided by arbitration if necessary.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> The local
authorities protested in vain against the agreement, their contention
being that the committee of investigation had advised
competition, whereas the government had on the other hand
succeeded only in making very unsatisfactory terms with the
company.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>In 1905, the Postmaster-General and the National Telephone
Company concluded an agreement for the purchase of the company's
provincial plant based upon much the same principles
which had governed the London agreement. The question of purchase
in the provinces was complicated by the fact that in some
towns there were competing municipal telephones, a resulting duplication
of plant, and an extension of the licence period beyond 1911.
By the terms of the agreement, the Postmaster-General on the
31st of December, 1911, shall buy and the National Telephone
Company shall sell (<i>a</i>) "all the plant, land, and buildings of the
company brought into use with the sanction of the Postmaster-General
and in use on the 31st of December, 1911, for the purpose
of the telephonic business of the Company, (<i>b</i>) any licensed
business of the company in towns where there are municipal exchanges
and where the licence extends beyond 1911, (<i>c</i>) the private
wire business of the company (for which no licence is required) in
use after the 31st of December, 1911, with buildings, plant, etc.,
(<i>d.</i>) all stores and buildings suitable for use in accordance with
specifications contained in the agreement, (<i>e</i>) all spare plant and
works under construction if suitable for the telephonic business
of the Post Office." The plant, land, and buildings were deemed
to be brought into use with the sanction of the Postmaster-General
if they were in use or being brought into use at the date of the
agreement; in the case of plant to be installed, if constructed in
accordance with specifications contained in the agreement and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234">[234]</a></span>land and buildings, if acquired or constructed with the consent of
the Postmaster-General. With reference to plant not constructed
in accordance with the specifications, and plant and buildings of
any kind in competitive areas, the Postmaster-General reserved
the right to object to buy such plant or buildings, the question of
suitability in competitive areas to be settled by arbitration. The
value to be paid for the company's undertaking, not in the competitive
areas and not being private wire business, shall be the
value on the date of purchase exclusive of any allowance for past
or future profits or any consideration for compulsory sale or any
other consideration. The value in competitive areas is to be determined
by agreement, regard being had to net profits and to the
circumstances and conditions under which the company would
carry on such business after the date of sale. The value of the private
wire business (apart from the plant, land, and buildings used
therein) is to be three years purchase of the net profits on the average
of the three years ending 31st of December, 1911. Any other
property or assets of the company may be purchased by the Postmaster-General,
the price to be determined by arbitration, if
necessary, and, after the date of sale, the telegraphic business of the
company will be carried on (whether by the company or the Postmaster-General)
at the expense and for the benefit of the Postmaster-General.
In the meantime the company agreed to maintain
its plant in good and efficient working order, not to show
favour or preference among its subscribers, to accept minimum
and maximum rates, to allow intercommunication without terminal
charges between their and the Post Office subscribers in the
same area, and not to collect terminal charges for messages sent
over the trunk lines between subscribers of the company and those
of the Post Office. The Postmaster-General agreed to extend to
subscribers of the company all such telegraphic and postal facilities
as his own subscribers enjoyed, and to undertake underground
works for the company elsewhere than in London under the same
conditions as in London. An agreement was also reached that similar
rates should be charged where the Postmaster-General and the
company maintained competing systems. As a result, measured
rates were, as a rule, substituted for the old flat rates, much to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235">[235]</a></span>
indignation of various Chambers of Commerce in the Kingdom.
In the case of complaint as to inefficient service, if the charge is
held to be proved before a person appointed by the Board of
Trade, and if it is not the result of a refusal to grant way-leaves,
the Postmaster-General may require the company to remedy conditions
in the particular area concerned or may call upon them to
sell the inefficient system to him. In the first case if there is no
improvement or if the second alternative has been adopted, the
Postmaster-General may require immediate sale under the same
terms that would have held if it had not taken place until the 31st
of December, 1911.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>The income received by the Post Office for the fiscal year
1906-07 from the London and provincial exchanges and trunk-line
business was £908,246, working expenses, £456,459, balance for
depreciation, interest, etc., £451,787, leaving a balance of £19,061
over and above an estimated amount of £432,726 for depreciation
and interest at three per cent on the capital expenditure. The
London exchange, with a gross income of £330,512, showed a surplus
of £25,586 over and above depreciation fund and interest on
capital expenditure, the provincial exchanges a deficit of £15,758,
and the trunk lines a surplus of £9333. The number of subscribers
to the Post Office provincial exchanges (excluding Glasgow and
Brighton) was 10,010. Including the Glasgow subscribers (11,103)
and the Brighton subscribers (1542), the total was 22,655. Arrangements
were then being made for local intercommunication
between subscribers of these exchanges and those of the company
in the same places. Hull and Portsmouth were the only towns
maintaining municipal telephonic systems in 1907, Hull having
2128 telephones in use and Portsmouth 2553. The number of telephones
in the London Post Office telephone service was 41,236,
including 425 public call offices. The agreement of 1905, providing
for similar rates in the provinces between exchanges of the Post
Office and those of the company, was followed after considerable
discussion by the announcement of the adoption of a new scale
in May, 1906. The rates are now based on the principle of a measured
service under which each subscriber pays according to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236">[236]</a></span>quality and quantity of the service desired. He may contract for
any number of calls from four hundred upward, and he may share
a line with another subscriber at a reduced rate, or he may rent
a line for his own exclusive use.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>


<p>The important points in the history of the British Post Office
are necessarily somewhat obscured by the great mass of less important
characteristics which accompanied its development. Organized
at the beginning of the sixteenth century as a means for
the conveyance of state letters, its messengers, by tacit consent, were
allowed to carry the letters of private individuals. The advantage
so afforded for the control of seditious correspondence led to the
monopolistic proclamations of the closing years of the sixteenth
and the opening years of the seventeenth century. Before 1635 the
state obtained no direct revenue for the conveyance of private
letters. The messengers or postmen who were supposed to be paid
by the state, derived the larger part of their income from the postage
on these letters and from letting horses to travellers.</p>

<p>The object in retaining for the Royal Posts the sole right to
carry the letters of private individuals assumed a new form in the
seventeenth century. Witherings showed that by diverting the
postage on private letters from the postmen to the state the Post
Office might be made self-supporting. Legal rates were imposed,
letters were carried at a much higher speed, and the system of
packet posts was extended over the great roads of England. The
supervision of private correspondence became a matter of only
secondary importance. The struggle between the King and Parliament
resulted in securing popular control over the posts of the
kingdom. At the same time, during the political unrest, competing
systems of posts were repressed with difficulty. The inability of
government officials to meet the increasing needs of a growing
metropolis led to the establishment of a Penny Post in London
by Dockwra, a private individual.</p>

<p>The first part of the eighteenth century saw the extension of a
postal system in the colonies and an attempt on the part of the Post<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
Office to obtain the postage on letters passing over the cross-roads
of England. The increase in England's colonial possessions and
her growing trade with foreign countries produced a corresponding
growth in the packet service. The last part of the century saw the
establishment of Palmer's mail coaches in order to meet competition
from the post coaches. The great increase in revenue which
accompanied the industrial revolution led to corruption among
the postal officials, resulting in the reform of 1793. The period
of rapid growth had passed, and the close of the eighteenth century
was a period of consolidation for the new offices which had been
created, and better coöperation in the work which they performed.</p>

<p>The first forty years of the last century saw the Post Office at
its best as an instrument of taxation. But this very fact drew
attention to the lack of other and more important objects. Rates
had been forced so high that people resorted to legal and illegal
means to evade paying them. The feeling was growing that a tax
upon correspondence was not only a poor method of raising money
but that its ulterior effect in restricting letter writing was producing
undesirable results upon the people of England industrially
and socially. A great mistake had been made by the Post Office
in acquiring steam packets. They suffered severely from
private competing lines and were always a loss to the Government.
A partial remedy was attained by the transfer of all the
packets to the Admiralty. Eventually the popular cause, championed
by Hill and Wallace, forced itself upon the attention of the
Government. A Parliamentary committee, after listening to the
evidence of representative witnesses, declared itself in favour of
low and uniform rates of postage for the United Kingdom, the result
being the adoption of inland Penny Postage in 1840.</p>

<p>Among the numerous changes which have characterized the
development of the Post Office since 1840 are the successive reductions
in rates; the transfer of the packet boats from the Admiralty,
followed by the resolution of the Government to revert to
the old principle of depending upon private enterprise for the sea
carriage of the mails; the extension in the use of the railways as a
medium of conveyance; the establishment of a parcel post; and
the decision of the government to provide banking and assurance
<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
facilities for the thrifty person of small means. But the greatest
departure in the field of the department's activities has been the
acquisition of the telegraphic system of the Kingdom. Misled by
their advisers as to the capital cost and induced by popular pressure
to abandon strictly business methods of administration and
extension, the telegraphic experiments of the department have
not been a financial success. Not only has this been the case, but,
in their efforts to protect the revenue, successive Governments
have hindered the development of telephonic communication.
At this late date we can safely assume that in 1870 the department
should either have granted the telephone companies far
greater powers or should themselves have assumed the burden of
providing an adequate system of telephonic communication. In
1911, the property and franchises of the telephone companies will
pass to the control of the Government, thus vastly increasing the
work of the department if, as seems probable, the Government
should assume direct management, and greatly enlarging the
number of dissatisfied members of that part of the civil service under
the control of the Post Office.</p>

<p>With reference to the foregoing bibliography, the "Letters and Papers
of Henry VIII" and the "Calendar of State Papers" have formed the
basis of this sketch of the British Post Office during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, with many references to the papers of private
individuals and institutions collected by the Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts. The "Proceedings and Ordinances and the Acts
of the Privy Council" contain important orders issued to the Postmaster-General
or the postmen during the sixteenth century as well as complaints
from the postmen and the public. From the beginning of the
eighteenth century the chief sources of information are the historical
summaries appended to the "Reports of Committees and Commissioners"
compiled during the first half of the nineteenth century. Of
these, the "Report of 1844" is the most important. The "Journals of
the Lords and Commons" throw some light upon the history, purpose,<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
and intent of the various acts of Parliament dealing with rates and
finance. "The Financial Report of 1797," various returns submitted
to the House of Commons, and the reports contained in the "Accounts
and Papers" for the first part of the nineteenth century are chiefly
concerned with the financial side of the history of the British Post Office.
Since 1840 the most important sources of information are the yearly
reports of the Postmasters-General, dating from 1854, and the voluminous
reports of committees appointed to investigate debated points in
the organization and policy of the Post Office as well as to advise
upon matters which had produced friction between the department
and its employees.</p>

<p>Of the secondary works there is little to be said. The only one from
which any important information has been obtained is Joyce's "History
of the British Post Office to 1836." This book contains a great deal
of valuable matter arranged in rather a haphazard fashion and with
no references. Writing as a Post Office official at the end of the nineteenth
century, Joyce hardly appreciated the conditions which his predecessors
had to meet. In Stow's "London" are found some interesting
facts about the London Penny Post, in Blomefield's "Norfolk" early
postal conditions in Norwich are described. The other books of the
same description contain only incidental references to minor points
of Post Office development.</p>

you.... To my great concern I have been since assured that such letters never go

the number sent from London 1,195,000. In 1796, the inward and outward free letters
